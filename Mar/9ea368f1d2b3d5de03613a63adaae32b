Initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 712 000 for the week ended March 6, compared to 754 000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 725 000 applications in the latest week. New coronavirus infections have dropped for eight straight weeks, declining 12% last week, according to a Reuters analysis of state, county and CDC data. Vaccinations jumped to a record 2.2 million shots per day and virus-related deaths fell 18%. That, together with nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief money advanced by the government in late December, fired up consumer spending and hiring in February after declining in December. Domestic demand is expected to surge in the months ahead, after Congress approved President Joe Bidenâ€™s $1.9 trillion recovery package, which will send fresh aid to small businesses as well as one-time $1 400 checks to mostly lower- and middle-income households. It will also extend a government-funded $300 weekly unemployment supplement through September 6. Jobless claims have been slow to decline with the improvement in economic activity and public health because of issues ranging from fraudulent filings, backlogs to recent winter storms in the South.
