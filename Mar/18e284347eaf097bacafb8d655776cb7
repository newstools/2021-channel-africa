On Wednesday, the country recorded the highest number of coronavirus cases in a day so far this year after registering 713 positive cases. “The sheer number itself tells you the whole story, the positivity rate that we are announcing at around 14% is also the highest since the last phase in November,” Kagwe said. The health ministry has also reported a rise in Covid-19 patients on ventilators in hospitals. "We are about to start another difficult period, but we can also overcome this period. It has taken a toll on us over the past year, and it is at this time that we can’t let our guard down." The Health Minister announced that together with other officials they will debate whether to increase or reduce the current measures to fight the virus. President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to address the country on Covid-19 control measures on Friday. --BBC--
