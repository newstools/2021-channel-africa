A joint statement by their foreign ministers affirmed their support for an “enhanced structure” of negotiation sponsored by the African Union (AU) that include the US, the European Union and the United Nations (UN). The ministers also noted that a unilateral filling of the dam for the second phase would be a direct threat to their countries’ water security. Egyptian President President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, who met Sudan's Foreign Minister Mariam al-Sadiq, said the dam was a vital issue for both countries. The plan for enhanced talks comes after Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi took over as AU chairman last month. Years of negotiations over the dam have been fruitless, including recent ones hosted by the US and the AU. Ethiopia sees the $4.8 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam as crucial to producing electricity to power its economic growth. But it has led to bitter disputes with Egypt and Sudan, both of which are downstream and fear the large dam will greatly reduce their access to water. --BBC--
