The International Organization for Migration (IOM) confirmed eight deaths, but officials at the United Nations (UN) agency said as many 30 might have been killed. It is not known what caused the blaze at the facility, which was holding hundreds of mostly Ethiopian migrants. But an air strike by a Saudi-led coalition fighting the rebel Houthi movement damaged buildings nearby. The coalition carried out the strikes on Sanaa as the Houthis launched drones and ballistic missiles at cities and oil installations in Saudi Arabia. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in 2015, when the Iran-aligned Houthis seized control of large parts of the country and the Saudi-led coalition launched an operation to restore the government's rule. The UN says the war has caused created the world's worst humanitarian crisis and caused an estimated 233 000 deaths, including 131 000 from indirect causes such as lack of food, health services and infrastructure. IOM Regional Director, Carmela Godeu, said in a tweet that both migrants and guards were among those who died in Sunday's fire. The migration group's staff were offering emergency care to more than 170 injured people, of whom at least 90 were in serious condition. --BBC--
