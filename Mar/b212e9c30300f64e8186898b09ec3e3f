The country received the first batch of 200 000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine on February 15 and launched the national vaccination exercise three days later. So far, more than 35 000 frontline workers have been inoculated against the disease and cabinet has resolved that the programme can move on to the second phase of the exercise. Zimbabwe is expecting to also receive the second donation of 200 000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine from China, a donation of 75 000 doses of the inactivated Covaxin from India, and another donation of 20 000 doses of Sputnik-V vaccine from Russia. Speaking during a virtual handover ceremony of reproductive health equipment to the government yesterday, Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Guo Shaochun said his country was impressed with the progress made on the first phase so far and would continue supporting the country’s efforts. “There are more opportunities for vaccine collaboration between China and Zimbabwe despite the enormous requirement of Covid-19 vaccines across the world. The next batch of 200 000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine donated by China is coming very soon, we expect it to arrive by mid-March. Zimbabwe government will also bring part of its procurement from China as well,” he said. Guo said the numbers of people who have been vaccinated showed that Zimbabweans were responding well to the exercise and the country could achieve success in its vaccination programme with more support from China and other development partners. --Herald--
