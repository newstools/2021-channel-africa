Those concerns overshadowed the prospect of the stimulus giving another boost to the world’s biggest economy and helping global growth rebound faster from the COVID-19 downturn. Analysts expect an acceleration in inflation, stoked in part by the latest spike in oil prices, which on Monday briefly climbed above $70 for the first time since the pandemic began. “Between reflation, inflation risk and equity valuations, there’s plenty of reasons for the market to be jittery over the bond re-pricing,” said Natixis strategist Florent Pochon. “Equity valuations will of course remain a burning issue, in particular for overly rich sectors,” he also said. But he added that sell-offs should be seen as buying opportunities, given that central banks remain “structurally dovish”. The MSCI world equity index fell 0.2% by 1215 GMT. Gains in European financial stocks were not enough to offset losses in Asia on sliding tech stocks and worries China could tighten policy to rein in pricey valuations. Nasdaq futures fell 1.2% in European trade, reversing early gains, and S&P 500 futures fell 0.4% as investors looked past the benefits of the fiscal package.
