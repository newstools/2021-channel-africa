Frontline health workers will be the first to get the jabs, according to the head of the countryâ€™s Healthcare Development Agency. The elderly and people with underlying conditions will also be prioritised. President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo will receive their jabs on Saturday. The country received a shipment of nearly four million doses of the vaccines earlier this week.
