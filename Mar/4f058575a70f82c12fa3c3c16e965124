In 2018, the unions reached an agreement with the Nigerian government on a minimum wage of $65 (30Â 000 naira) a month. But some state governments say they can't afford to pay this and want to introduce a separate, lower minimum wage. In the capital, Abuja, union leaders and their members have marched to the parliament building in protest at this move. --BBC--
