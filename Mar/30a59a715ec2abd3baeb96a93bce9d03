Some reports say they were shot in their homes, others say they were taken from a church and shot in a forest. Another 20 people were kidnapped and later released. A local official said the gunmen were members of the rebel Oromo Liberation Army. Most of the dead are said to be members of the Amhara ethnic group. Hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians have been displaced by ethnic violence since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018.
