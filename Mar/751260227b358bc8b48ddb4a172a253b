Brent crude fell 3 cents, or less than 0.1%, to $67.49 a barrel by 1137 GMT and US West Texas Intermediate crude rose 10 cents, or 0.2%, to $64.11. The pandemic-hit global economy is set to rebound with 5.6% growth this year and expand 4% next year, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its interim economic outlook. Its previous forecast had been for growth of 4.2% this year. “When it comes to lifting market sentiment, there is very little that can rival an upgrade to the post-COVID economic recovery,” said Stephen Brennock of broker PVM.
 
Prices also gained support from the decision by the OPEC+ producer group to largely maintain production cuts in April. “In our view, the March 4 OPEC+ meeting has not just left the door to higher prices open, it has taken that door off its hinges and chopped it up for firewood,” Standard Chartered said in a note. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud on Wednesday that Saudi Arabia and Russia were keen for fair oil prices and will continue their cooperation in the framework of the OPEC+ group.

However, prices remained under pressure from a combination of factors including top importers China and India drawing crude from storage at current high prices and expectations of a return of Iranian supplies, analysts said.
