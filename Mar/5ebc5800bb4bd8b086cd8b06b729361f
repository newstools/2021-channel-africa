S&P said it would review its attitude towards South Africa if fiscal financing or external pressures mount. S&P is the third major credit rating agency to remain unconvinced by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s Budget presented two weeks ago. S&P director Ravi Bhatia yesterday expressed concern over South Africa’s rising debt levels. He said South Africa has been plagued by a long period of low economic growth, lacklustre structural reforms and fiscal pressures. He said the country’s greatest risk to its credit status was its large and rising fiscal deficit and debt burden, as well as contingent liabilities. In November, S&P downgraded South Africa’s sovereign debt to BB with a stable outlook. Bhatia said the current outlook for South Africa was stable and evenly balanced. “But we could lower the ratings if we see South Africa fail to recover the forecasted rebounded growth, especially fiscal financing pressures becoming significant,” Bhatia said. “We have seen a fiscal problem, but the latest debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) numbers have risen so much that it could translate into a fiscal financing problem and to a lesser extent an external problem, although the current account picture has been reasonably good lately.” The 2021 Budget framework put South Africa on course to achieve a primary surplus after stabilising debt at 88.9% of GDP in 2025/26. --IOL--
