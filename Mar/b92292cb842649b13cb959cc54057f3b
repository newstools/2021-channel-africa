While US airlines received billions of dollars in federal grants to cover payroll costs over the past year, American also secured up to $7.5 billion of term loans from the US Treasury to help it navigate the coronavirus pandemic.  

Under the deal announced on Monday, American will issue a private offering of notes worth about $5 billion, half due in 2026 and half in 2029, and a $2.5 billion term loan credit facility. Shares were up 2.4% in morning trade. In January, the airline authorized a $1 billion stock sale, following an ongoing $1 billion offering launched in October to boost liquidity. The company’s subsidiary American Airlines Inc and AAdvantage Loyalty IP Ltd - an indirect owned subsidiary - intend to commence the offering.
