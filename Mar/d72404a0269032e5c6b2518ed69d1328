The deal stipulates that the AfDB will provide sanitation services in residential communities in Luxor’s rural areas. “Egypt is supporting efforts aimed at developing the sanitation sector across all governorates to enhance the lifestyle of rural communities by improving living conditions and by improving their ability to achieve food security,” it added, noting that this development financing amount will also go to building on the capacities of workers at the Potable Water and Sanitation Company in Luxor. The ministry clarified that this deal comes within the framework of the role played by the Ministry of International Co-operation to coordinate between multilateral and bilateral development partners, and various government entities, so as to manage development funds secured for priority projects that benefit the citizens and support Egypt’s national development agenda.  Minister of International Co-operation, Rania Al-Mashat, said that the strategic relationship between AfDB and the Ministry of International Co-operation has contributed to the provision of many development funds across various sectors that have enhanced Egypt's efforts in achieving sustainable development. Al-Mashat noted that the ministry is keen on coordinating with multilateral and bilateral development partners to support state projects with regards to drinking water and the sanitation sector, as both are vital to the country’s 2030 National Agenda in terms of water resource management and sustainable development. Al-Mashat explained that the water and sewage networks were among the sectors that benefited the most from development funds provided by the Ministry of International Co-operation through development partners, during the past year with $1.4 billion. This includes $500 million that went to social housing projects and $900 million that went to water and sewage networks. The AfDB is among the development partners that made these projects possible. The on-going co-operation portfolio between the Ministry of International Co-operation and the AfDB amounts to about $640.8 million covering various development sectors such as electricity, health, research, entrepreneurship, budget support, and water and sanitation.  --EgyptToday--
