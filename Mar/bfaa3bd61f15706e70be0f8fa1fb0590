After economic pressures caused by the coronavirus pandemic put many out of work, Maysoun Abdelsalam and her husband Moataz Ibrahim pivoted to serving them food. “We felt we were the support for each other, between us refugees. One person brings rice, one brings pasta,” said Abdelsalam. The couple, who were working as a journalist and a lawyer, left Sudan because of political pressures and came to Egypt with their three children in 2017 hoping to find some security and stability. Abdelsalam, 36, and Ibrahim, 44, found a niche teaching the children of other Sudanese migrants, setting up the Future Generation Centre for Education charity shortly after they arrived. Though the economic downturn caused by the pandemic has not been as severe in Egypt as in some other countries, many migrants and refugees have lost their jobs. “There’s no work, and I can’t find any help from anyone except this centre,” said Zakaria Issa, who came to Egypt from fleeing war in Sudan’s Darfur region. In 2020, United Nations (UN) migration agency IOM estimated that a fifth of an estimated 6.3 million foreigners in Egypt were in need of assistance. More than 300 000 are registered refugees and asylum seekers, according to the UN refugee agency, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. A few days a week the centre prepares meals with meat and vegetables to distribute to up to 400 families from Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Yemen, as well as some Egyptian families.
