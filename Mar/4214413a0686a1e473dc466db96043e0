Mozambique has been battling the insurgency in the mineral-rich province of Cabo Delgado since October 2017. Half a million people are said to have been forced from their homes in the past year alone. The al-Ansar al-Sunna group, locally known as al-Shabab, has been responsible for dozens of terror attacks which are estimated to have killed hundreds of civilians. Amnesty International this month published a report that accused Mozambique’s army, private military contractors and militants operating in Cabo Delgado of committing war crimes. --BBC
