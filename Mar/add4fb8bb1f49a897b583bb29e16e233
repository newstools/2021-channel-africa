“Al Ahly’s coaching staff decided to impose a fine of $12 000 on the team's player, Mahmoud Kahraba, and rule him out of matches for one month for lack of commitment.” Al Ahly’s statement said.

Reports said that the player had a conflict with the first team’s Head Coach, Pitso Mosimane, after the match against El Geish SC in the Egyptian league.

According to reports, the player argued with the head coach after the match and Mosimane decided to punish the player for his bad behaviour.

On a similar note, Al Ahly continued the preparations for the game against Congo’s AS Vita Club, scheduled on Saturday in Match day 3 of the CAF Champions League group stage.

The Red Devils aim to bounce back after losing to Simba in Tanzania 1-0.
