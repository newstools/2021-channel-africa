President Teodoro Obiang Nguema has blamed the blasts in the city of Bata on stubble burning by farmers and negligence in the storage of explosives. The blasts flattened homes and tore the roofs off buildings. Debris was strewn across a wide area. The health ministry in the oil rich Central African country said hospitals had been overwhelmed. It urged people to donate blood and asked off duty doctors to help. --BBC--
