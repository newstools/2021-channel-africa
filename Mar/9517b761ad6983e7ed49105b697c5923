Reports also claim that Huawei will be opening up its wrist wearables ecosystem (running on its LiteOS) to third-party developers in a bid to attract more buyers. As a proof of concept, the company has released the popular fitness app “Fitify” for the Watch GT 2 Pro. This step reaffirms Huawei’s commitment towards its All-scenario Seamless AI Life Strategy and working with partners to nurture the 1+8+N ecosystem, as Huawei is expected to collaborate with developers to bring users a more cohesive connected experience to consumers in their everyday lives. This will allow the users to benefit from new innovative capabilities that Huawei wearable devices will provide, echoing Huawei’s mission to build a better-connected world. Huawei’s 1+8+N ecosystem keeps the smartphone at its center as an entry point for consumers. This connects with eight categories of smart devices for different scenarios, PCs, tablets, smart TVs, audio devices, smart glasses, smart watches, and headphones. The N stands for the layer where everything comes together and denotes the thousands of “Internet of Things - IoT” enabled devices that can be seamlessly connected. The “+” sign in between represents Huawei Share and HiLink, the very technology that makes this connection effortless.  --EgyptToday--
