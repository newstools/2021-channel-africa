The parliament’s approval of Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibeh’s cabinet by 132 votes to two against, at a session in a war-battered frontline city, represents the biggest opportunity in years for a resolution to Libya’s conflict. “Through this vote, it became clear that the Libyans are one unit,” Dbeibeh told parliament afterwards. He urged Libyans to “open your hearts to one another and forget the grudges”. However, huge hurdles remain and the manner of Dbeibeh’s own appointment and the expansive size of his cabinet have drawn criticism in Libya with accusations of corruption and influence peddling that spoilers could leverage to deny his legitimacy. On the ground, Libya’s streets, businesses and even its institutions of state remain in the shadow of myriad armed forces and split between two warring administrations, while foreign powers backing either side have kept their guns in place. Holding free parliamentary and presidential elections in such circumstances in 2021 will be an immense challenge, though all sides have formally committed to do so. First the constitution must be amended, another difficult undertaking. “If we come out of this with one government and one set of institutions then we’re already in a far superior place than we’ve been for the last five years,” said Tarek Megerisi of the European Council on Foreign Relations. The parliament session was in Sirte, where the front lines stabilised last summer after the internationally recognised Government of National Accord pushed Khalifa Haftar’s eastern-based Libyan National Army back from Tripoli. --Reuters--
