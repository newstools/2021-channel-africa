“This agreement shall be open to accession by any state that is a Contracting Party to The Treaty for the Establishment of the East African Community. A request for accession shall be submitted to the EPA Council,” reads the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA). The agreement shall also be reviewed after every five years from the date of its entry into force. The trade pact seeks to provide full duty-free and quota-free market access conditions for goods originating from an EAC Partner State into the UK market on a secure, long-term and predictable basis and liberalise progressively and gradually an EAC Partner State’s market for goods originating from the UK. Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda had demanded the extension of the negotiations period by one year so that they could sign the agreement as a bloc. The EAC Customs Union Protocol, the first pillar of regional integration, requires all EAC countries to negotiate as a bloc matters related to trade with third parties. However, a member may separately negotiate bilateral trade agreements, subject to notification and approval by other members. The EAC partner states through the Secretariat made a proposal to the British government seeking an extension of the period for the negotiations of a new trade agreement by one year until December 2021 and that during this period Kenya be allowed to continue having preferential market access to the UK market after December 31, 2020. --TheEastAfrican--
