“The Sudanese authorities have made tangible progress toward establishing a strong track record of policy and reform implementation - a key requirement for eventual debt relief”, an IMF statement said, citing a recent devaluation of the currency and removal of fuel subsidies. The IMF warned that the economic situation remained “extremely fragile” in Sudan, where a deep economic crisis has seen inflation of up to 300% and shortages of basic goods. “Authorities should implement the reform of the customs exchange rate in a timely fashion to lift revenue and competitiveness and avoid a return to distortionary policy measures,” the statement said. “Enhanced transparency and management of State-Owned Enterprises operations is vital to mitigate fiscal risks and bring more revenue on-budget,” it added. The IMF also called for the timely adoption of a central bank act and the establishment of an independent anti-corruption commission. --Reuters--
