Under the agreement, Kenya will maintain its duty and quota-free access for its agricultural products such as tea, coffee, cut flowers, fruits and vegetables to the UK market. On the other hand, import taxes on 82.6% of products originating from the UK will be abolished after 25 years. A court case has been filed by small scale farmers who have complained of lack of public participation. The passing into law of the deal named the Economic Partnership Agreement came a day after the UK MPs did the same, paving the way for the pact to be implemented. In endorsing the deal, Kenya’s parliament will now require the country’s industrialisation minister to submit to it an annual progress report and an economic assessment on the gains, losses and developments arising from the implementation of the deal. The annual value of trade between Kenya and the UK is estimated at between $638 million. --BBC--
