Most of those rescued on Sunday are African migrants from Cameroon, Sudan and Mali, the AFP reports. Many of the survivors suffered from burns and hypothermia, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). On Friday, IOM Libya said more than over 150 migrants had been intercepted and returned to the country by its coast guard. It noted that at least 3 700 men, women, and children have been returned to Libya this year, whose conditions have continued to worsen after being detained. --BBC--
