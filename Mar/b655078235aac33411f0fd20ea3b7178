In a statement, Safaricom said the solution would aid HELB to promote responsible spending. Funds will be locked for specific allocations, such as tuition or library fees, and only accessible to the specific Paybill account of the recipient’s university or TVET institution. The students’ upkeep allowance can now also be transferred into the student’s M-Pesa wallet for everyday use. “Technology today is not only revolutionising every aspect of our lives, but also creating opportunities to enhance efficiency and accountability. We are pleased to support the Higher Education Loans Board to deploy a solution that suits the digital lifestyle of students in tertiary institutions,” said chief financial services officer at Safaricom Sitoyo Lopokoiyit. HELB disbursed more than $137 million to more than 200 000 beneficiaries annually. Part of the loan was usually channelled directly to the learning institution to settle part of the tuition and accommodation fees, while the rest was sent to the student for upkeep. Safaricom said the solution would create efficiencies for all stakeholders by reducing queues during registration as students can now pay through their mobile phones. There would be effective management and monitoring of all loans throughout the loan life cycle. --IOL--
