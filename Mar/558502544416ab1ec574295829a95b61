The group said the estimated share of MPCs would be $319 million. The group said the settlement consideration would be paid through its Stichting Steinhoff Recovery Foundation (SRF) by way of 50% in cash and 50% in shares indirectly owned by the group in Pepkor Holdings. Steinhoff's participating claimants are categorised as MPCs, contractual claimants and financial creditors. The group said the proposed global settlement required the support of participating claimants, and the implementation process was expected to take a number of months. Steinhoff said the implementation of the Steinhoff global settlement would require the requisite support of claimants and approvals by the Dutch and South African courts. The offer comes after Steinhoff made an application to the Amsterdam District Court on Monday for a suspension of payments procedure, which was followed by the launching of a statutory compromise process under South African law, also as part of the implementation of the Steinhoff Group global settlement. Steinhoff has already been given support by Deloitte after its former auditor agreed to pay $84.6 million to claimants on Monday. However, it emphasised that it was not admitting to any wrongdoing. Conservatorium also withdrew its application to appoint a restructuring expert yesterday after the parties were involved in constructive engagements. --IOL--
