"We put on a good showing, it was a great performance, we had a lot of chances in the first half but we just missed the finishing touch which was a shame," Griezmann told Movistar Plus after Barca had 20 attempts on goal but only scored courtesy of a Lionel Messi thunderbolt in the first half. Messi then had a penalty saved by Keylor Navas as Barcelona fell short of repeating their remarkable comeback against PSG in 2017, when they lost 4-0 in the first leg in Paris but won 6-1 in the return. "We said we would give the most effort possible and it wasn't to be. We still have the league and the cup left and we have to give everything in them." The five-time European champions had not been knocked out before the quarter-finals since 2006/07 when, with Messi aged 19, they lost to Liverpool in the last 16. "This match gives us confidence but we're gutted," Griezmann continued. "We wanted to go through, the fans and the players don't deserve for this team to go out so early but we will come back next year and try to win." Coach Ronald Koeman admitted that the outcome could have been different had Messi's penalty in first-half stoppage time, with the score at 1-1, gone in rather than been pushed onto the bar by Navas. --IOL--
