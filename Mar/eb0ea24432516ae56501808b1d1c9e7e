Flutterwave lets customers pay in their local currencies and allows people to send money from the United States (US) to a mobile money wallet, charging sellers a small service fee, which it shares with banks. The technology news site Tech Crunch says that this latest investment makes the company another African "unicorn", a term for companies valued at more than $1 billion. The success of this fundraising round is seen by some observers as the latest illustration of a growing interest in the payments market in Africa. In October US payments company Stripe bought Nigerian fintech business Paystack for $200 million and in 2019 Visa bought a 20% stake in Nigerian payments company Interswitch, the main platform for the countryâ€™s business-to-business transactions. --BBC--
