Zimbabwe Miners Federation (ZMF) chief executive Wellington Takavarasha, told a webinar on the status of the gold mining sector that only 16% of small or artisanal miners were formerly registered. This scenario means the government is not deriving optimum benefits from the “illegal activities” of small and artisanal miners, as most are not registered and have no identity. There are 1.5 million small and artisanal miners in Zimbabwe, but only a tiny fraction runs registered or formalised operations. It is believed that Zimbabwe loses hundreds of millions of United States dollars each year through the smuggling of gold. Zimbabwe produced 21,44 tonnes of gold in 2016, 24,44t in 2017, 33,89t in 2018, 27,589t in 2019, and 19,05t last year lack of formalisation played seriously affected production and deliveries from small and artisanal miners in 2020. These included lack of sophisticated equipment, working capital and Covid-19 restrictions, among others. At its height, Zimbabwe produced about 29 tonnes back in 1999. The small and artisanal miners sectors accounts for an average of 60%, since 2017, of the total annual gold deliveries to Fidelity Printers and Refineries (FPR). The miners contribution plunged to as low as 982 kilogrammes when the Government launched blitz to stop the “illegal” mining activities. --Herald--
