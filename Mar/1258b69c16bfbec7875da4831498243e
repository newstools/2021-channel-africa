The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) says the collapse in international tourism has hit conservation budgets hard. Patrols and anti-poaching operations have been halted or reduced in more than half of Africa's protected areas, and a quarter of those in Asia. Many rangers have lost their jobs or seen their salaries reduced or delayed. The IUCN says growing poverty in communities near parks has seen a rise in poaching for bush meat. --BBC--
