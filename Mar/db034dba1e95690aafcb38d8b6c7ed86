AB InBev, which operates in more than 50 countries, serves key markets such as Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador and South Africa. Revenue was up by 4.5% compared to a 3.7% decline for the full-year. Its total volumes for the fourth quarter to end December increased by 1.6%, with own beer volumes up by 1.8% and non-beer volumes up by 1.7%, but full-year total volumes declined by 5.7%, primarily driven by impact of the Covid19 pandemic. In South Africa, the group, which owns brands such as Budweiser, Stella, Artois and Corona, said the multiple alcohol bans impacted its performance, though underlying consumer demand remained strong. “Our business in South Africa was significantly impacted by three outright government-mandated bans on the sale of alcohol over the course of 2020, which resulted in double-digit volume, revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) declines and significant Ebitda margin contraction,” AB InBev said. AB InBev also expected the adverse channel and packaging mix, coupled with transactional forex and commodity headwinds, to put pressure on its financial year 2021 Ebitda margin. --IOL--
