Isaac Sturgeon was seized by the FBI on arrival at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. He had been staying in the East Africa country since January 24, according to court documents. He was planning to return to the US in April. Sturgeon is accused of shoving a metal police barricade into police officers during the January riots. He was charged with seven counts and was released on a $250 000 bond, the New York Post reports. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, it adds. The riots happened in January during a joint session of Congress convened to count the electoral college votes and certify President Joe Bidenâ€™s victory in the November 3 elections. They left five people dead, over 100 police officers injured and millions of dollars in damage to the building. --BBC--
