Fourth-quarter sales rose a currency-neutral 1% to €5.548 billion ($6.59 billion), while operating profit slipped slightly to €225 million ($267.3 million), both ahead of average analyst forecasts for 5.47 billion and 202 million respectively. Now that more than 95% of its stores have reopened after coronavirus lockdowns, Adidas expects sales to increase at a mid-to high-teens rate on a currency-neutral basis, rising up to 30% in greater China, the rest of Asia and Latin America. Net income from continuing operating is set to rise to between €1.25 billion ($1.48 billion) and €1.45 billion ($1.72 billion) However, Adidas said it expects a hit of around €250 million ($297 million) to the operating profit level and 200 million to net income due to costs to set up Reebok as a stand-alone company, with a third of that to reoccur in 2022, but none by 2023. Adidas said in February it plans to sell or spin-off the underperforming brand, 15 years after it bought the United States fitness label to help compete with arch-rival Nike Inc. --Reuters--
