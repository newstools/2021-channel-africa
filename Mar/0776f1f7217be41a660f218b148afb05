Classes have to be kept at a maximum of 35 pupils, a ratio of teachers to pupils that requires more staff. The same tightening of ratios has long been desired as a permanent change by teachers and other education experts to allow more personal attention to be given to all pupils, so helping to upgrade education systems. The increase in staff is also in line with President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s directive that all qualified but unemployed teachers be engaged to take advantage of the investments being made in teacher training to improve schooling. The new 3 000 professionals will join the 5 300 recently engaged by the government to cope with the smaller classes. Of these, 2 300 were employed late last year while the paperwork for the other 3 000 was completed early this year. Primary and Secondary Education Minister Ambassador Cain Mathema announced the on-going process of identifying and recruiting suitable personnel for teaching vacancies. “We are employing 3 000 more teachers soon so that they will start working during the first term. "Covid-19 regulations require that we break classes into smaller groups of not more than 35, and to do that we have to employ more teachers. The President ordered that we should employ all qualified teachers. He said we cannot just be training teachers and not employing them. So with this recruitment we are implementing what was directed by the President,” said Mathema. Assessment of whether all teachers have returned to work after the Covid-19 pandemic will be done once the schools have reopened. --Herald--
