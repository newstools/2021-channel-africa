A Spokesperson for the UNHCR, Xavier Bourgois, said about 340 returnees were being moved by bus and truck from Minawao camp in Cameroon to their original home town of Banki in Borno State. They are the first of about 10 000 Nigerians who have expressed a willingness to return home following an agreement in February between Cameroon and Nigeria. The Boko Haram insurgency, which spread to Cameroon, Chad and Niger, has displaced over two million people in the region. --BBC--
