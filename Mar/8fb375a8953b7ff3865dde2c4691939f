But he said he is legally bound by the decision of the court. On Thursday, the Supreme Court upheld Nana AkufAddoâ€™s victory, dismissing allegations of irregularities. Reacting to the court's verdict, Mahama expressed disappointment that the Head of the Electoral Commission, Jean Mensa, did not testify on alleged irregularities. The Supreme Court ruled that the opposition leader had failed to prove that none of the candidates had reached the over 50% threshold required to win the presidential election in the first round. It also said that alterations of declared results by the Electoral Commission had not significantly impacted the result. According to the court, the declaration of the results was therefore legal and represented the will of the people. --BBC--
