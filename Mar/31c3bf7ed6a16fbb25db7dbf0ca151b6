AfDB President Dr Akinwumi Adesina spoke of Tanzania's economic resilience in his brief salutations to Africa during which he extended his congratulations to President John Magufuli following his re-election in the last October 2020 General Election. "Firstly, I wish to congratulate President John Magufuli in his re-election, your re- election as President is an excellent opportunity to continue to build a prosperous Tanzania," he said. Adesina cautioned other leaders in Africa to take note that Magufuli is a man of action, especially when it comes to projects implementation. "Now let me warn you, President Magufuli is a doer. Now talking about projects does not cut with him, he is a man in a hurry, he is about finishing projects and moving on to the next one. So, you get ready. President Magufuli and his office of investments led by State Minister, Kitila Mkumbo will vigorously engage you," he sounded the alert ahead of the forum for project developers and investors. "Second, I want to commend the organisers for organising this forum for project developers, investors, of Tanzania's boundless investment opportunities. Now you have come to the right place,Tanzania‚Äù, he added. Speaking on Tanzania's economic growth, Adesina said the country achieved real GDP growth of 6.9% in 2019. "Now while growth slowed down in Africa to -2.1% in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic we are all dealing with, Tanzania still managed to record a growth of 2.1%, that is great," he said. "Now, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, the African Development Bank forecasted strong economic recovery for Tanzania in 2021," he added. He said Tanzania has demonstrated its strong commitment to transparency, accountability, and has a highly commendable anti-corruption stance. "This is therefore the place to be." --AllAfrica--
