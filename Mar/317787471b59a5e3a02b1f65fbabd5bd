The visit comes after Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, had last week urged Ethiopia to allow an international investigation into alleged atrocities in the region. It is unclear what access Ambassador Geeta Pasi will be granted in Tigray, but the embassy said in a tweet that the US is "committed to providing life-saving assistance to vulnerable populations in Ethiopia". The Tigray region descended into conflict on November 4, 2020, when Ethiopia's government launched an offensive to oust the Tigray People's Liberation Front after its fighters captured federal military bases in Tigray. Allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity have since emerged, with the United Nations human rights commissioner calling on Ethiopia to allow independent experts into the region. --BBC--
