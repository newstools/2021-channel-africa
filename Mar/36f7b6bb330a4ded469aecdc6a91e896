The group, which includes the Austrian Airlines, Swiss and Eurowings brands, trimmed its 2021 capacity plans as Covid-19 disruption drags on but said it still hoped for a summer upturn. “We are examining whether all aircraft older than 25 years will remain on the ground permanently,” Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said, pledging to make 2021 “a year of redimensioning and modernisation” for the company. Lufthansa posted a $1.38 billion fourth-quarter net loss with a $1.29 billion deficit in adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT). Revenue fell 71%. Summer travel will nonetheless pick up swiftly as and when restrictions are eased, Spohr said, and the group stands ready to restore 70% of its flight schedule “in the short term”. --IOL--
