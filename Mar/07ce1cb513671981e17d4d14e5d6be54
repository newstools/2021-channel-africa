The IOM says that as many migrants are in a critical condition, meeting their health needs must be an urgent priority. "We are facing challenges accessing the injured due to an increased security presence in the hospitals,‚Äù IOM Middle East and North Africa director Carmela Godeau said in a statement on Tuesday. It's not clear how many of the hundreds of people were killed or injured in the fire at a centre in Sana'a. The IOM says more than 170 have been treated for injuries with many still in a critical condition. A Yemeni human rights group, Mwatana, has issued a report suggesting that the number of those who died is far higher than the figure of eight given so far. --BBC--
