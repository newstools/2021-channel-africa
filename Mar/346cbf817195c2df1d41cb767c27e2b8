As her breathing and blood pressure deteriorated, she was given azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine and put on a ventilator. 

Eleven days after being admitted to the same hospital where she had worked for years as a nurse, Susan went into cardiac arrest and died at age 60. Steve Cicala is now the first person known to be pursuing a COVID-19 claim with a decade-old United States (US) government fund that has up to $30 billion that can be used to compensate for serious injuries or deaths caused by treatments or vaccines in the fight against the pandemic. COVID-19 presents the first serious test of the Countermeasure Injury Compensation Program (CICP) overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).   

The program so far has denied compensation in 90% of the cases filed prior to the pandemic, mostly for H1N1 flu vaccines. Cicala’s claim has not been previously reported. He could receive around $367 000 from the virtually untapped fund if he can show the treatment caused his wife’s death. He is not alleging negligence against the hospital, which is largely protected from liability by an emergency health law. “There’s nothing that’s going to bring her back,” said Cicala, “but obviously with our two children and now two grandchildren, if there’s something that we could do to help them out, that would be nice.” Cicala, 58, said he believed the hospital provided the best care possible. Clara Maass declined to comment.
