“All three have committed war crimes, causing the deaths of hundreds of civilians," said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa. "The international community has failed to address this crisis as it has escalated into full-blown armed conflict over the last three years." The watchdog urged all parties to immediately stop targeting civilians and called on the Mozambican government to investigate the abuses. Last year, several videos emerged showing alleged soldiers carrying out abuses against suspected militants and residents during counter-insurgency operations in Cabo Delgado. Mozambique has been battling an insurgency since October 2017 in which more than 2 300 people have been killed and over 600 000 others have been forced from their homes. --BBC--
