The election is part political reforms promised by the President to address demands by protesters. The President dissolved the lower house of parliament on February 18, a year ahead of schedule, to calm down protesters. Elections are supposed to be conducted within five months of the dissolution, according to the country's laws. Tebboune also released about 60 detainees of the Hirak anti-government protest movement and others who had been awaiting trial. Algeria's street protests brought down President Abdulaziz Bouteflika in 2019, and then continued as the demonstrators pressed in vain for a sweeping away of the rest of the political establishment. --BBC--
