In line with this year’s International Women’s Day theme of “Women in Leadership: Achieving an Equal Future in a COVID-19 World,” the President says the pandemic has once more demonstrated women’s capacity to organise, collaborate, lead and achieve. Writing in his weekly letter to the nation, Ramaphosa says through their actions, women have proved that there is no such thing as ‘a woman’s place’. President Cyril Ramaphosa says the women of South Africa have played a pivotal role in the country’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He has lauded the resilience and bravery of women frontline workers such as nurses, doctors, emergency workers, police, and soldiers. He has also thanked female educators, civil society activists, researchers, business leaders, and scientists for their contribution. Ramaphosa says this sets a standard and must encourage South Africans to build an equal future for all. The Motsepe Foundation is hosting the 5th annual Gender Equality, Wellness and Leadership Summit as part of the International Women’s Day celebrations. --sabc--
