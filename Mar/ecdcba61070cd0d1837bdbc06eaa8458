Osimhen was named in a 24-man squad by Nigerian Manager, Gernot Rohr, earlier this week, despite having only recently returned from a series of injury and illness issues. The Napoli striker suffered a dislocated shoulder in November 2020 while on international duty with the Super Eagles, and then contracted Covid-19 while celebrating his 22nd birthday on leave in Nigeria the following month. He recovered from those setbacks, only to suffer a head injury in a match against Atalanta in February which saw him miss the Neapolitans’ next seven matches. Calenda, in response to Osimhen’s call-up, is quoted by All Nigeria Soccer: “He was called up, then he will decide. Let’s hope you don’t have to worry more than anything else. Calenda added that Osimhen needs more time to get back to his best, having spent so much of the season on the sidelines. “He has been out for a long time and hasn’t trained together with the team for a long time,” explained the agent. “It takes time to group and connect. The work has to be done together. “Victor was out 94 days in a row and then returned to Bergamo. I am the first to wish that he can do well but we always give time to time, these are important things.” Nigeria will face Benin away from home on March 27, before wrapping up their campaign with a home clash against Lesotho three days later. The Super Eagles need only one win to guarantee a place in next year’s AFCON finals. --AllAfrica--
