Dr Richard Laku, the country's COVID-19 incident manager, said that officials from Juba City Council or any security agent will have the power to order people not wearing masks to return home. He said he was concerned about the increase in coronavirus cases among health workers. At least 47 have contracted the virus since last week. "If our health workers are getting infected in big numbers, this tells us that, actually our facilities in general are not doing well in terms of infection prevention-control, and I think it is a concern that needs to be addressed," Dr Laku said. The majority of the cases are in the capital, Juba, which has recorded the most infections in the country. --BBC--
