Local exports saw serious disruptions in the movement across borders as some markets imposed bans on non-strategic and non-essential products. National trade promotion body, ZimTrade, says the processed food exports from Zimbabwe increased to US$115 million from US$98 million in the same period in 2019, far outweighing overall export growth of 2.47%. Top exported products included sugar (US$76 million), fruit juices (US$5.6 million) and pastry products (US$3.7 million), which posted stellar growth despite restrictions to trade, production and movement due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ZimTrade said for traders seeking to venture into export business, the processed foods sector could be a low-hanging fruit considering steady growth over the past few years. According to recent statistics published by ZimStats, Zimbabwe’s overall exports grew by 2.7% between January-December 2020 compared to the previous year. In terms of monitory value, the nation’s exports last year stood at US$4.39 billion, up from US$4,28 billion recorded same period in 2019. Although this falls short of the 10% export growth set under the National Export Strategy, it reflects commendable efforts that went to ensure the country retains a positive export growth. In terms of product composition, primary commodities dominated exports in the period under review. Mineral exports stood at US$3,210 billion during 2020, contributing 73% to total exports. --Herald--
