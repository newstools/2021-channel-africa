The East Africans held their opponents 0-0 after extra time in their quarterfinal in Nouakchott, before claiming a 5-3 penalty shootout triumph. “I am happy with the way the boys handled the game through the 120 minutes because we came up against a tough team, very physical and quite competitive,” Byekwaso told Football265. “But I felt we matched them pound for pound and the boys recognised how tough a challenge it was and conducted themselves well not giving them the advantage and holding it out for the entire game. “When we got to penalties they did well to hold their nerve and with luck on our side we prevailed from the game.” Uganda, in their maiden U-20 AFCON, finished second in Group A behind Cameroon, including wins over Mozambique and hosts Mauritania. They will now face Tunisia in the second semi-final in Nouakchott on Monday night, following on the earlier game between Ghana and Gambia. --AllAfrica--
