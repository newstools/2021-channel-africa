Sonko was freed from detention on Monday but still faces a rape charge - which he says is politically motivated. At least eight people have died during days of violent protests in Senegal sparked by the arrest of Mr Sonko on charges of public disorder. Sonko denies he is trying to overthrow President Macky Sall, who has called for calm. Sall has promised to shorten a curfew and provide extra funding for entrepreneurship. --BBC--
