St John was one of Liverpool’s leading players of the 1960’s and later went on to become a popular presenter of “Saint and Greavsie”, a lunchtime football show with former England striker Jimmy Greaves. The Scot was a key part of the Liverpool team managed by Bill Shankly, earning promotion to the top flight in his debut season after joining for a then club-record fee of $52 000 from Motherwell. St John, who scored 118 goals in more than 400 games for Liverpool from 1961-71, passed away on Monday evening. "It is with a heavy heart that we have to inform you that after a long illness we have lost a husband, father and grandfather," St John's family said in a statement. “He passed away peacefully with his family at his bedside.” St John’s most famous goal was the extra-time winner in Liverpool’s 2-1 win over Leeds United in the 1965 FA Cup final, a diving header which secured the club’s maiden Cup triumph in an era when that competition enjoyed huge status. He was also part of the team which won the league title the previous year, Liverpool’s first since 1947, and again in 1966. He made 21 appearances for Scotland, scoring nine goals, one of them coming in the famous 6-2 win against Spain in Madrid in 1963.  --AllAfrica--
