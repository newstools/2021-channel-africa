It happened at Pieri airstrip shortly after take-off while heading to the capital, Juba. A team of investigators was being sent to the site of the crash to conduct preliminary investigations, Transport Minister Madut Biar Yel said. The plane belonged to a local aviation company, the South Supreme Airlines. The firm has not yet issued a statement about the crash. Jonglei State Governor Denay Jock Chagor said he received the news with "shock and horror" and sent condolences to the families and friends of the deceased. South Sudan's air safety profile is not yet rated by the International Aviation Safety Assessment Programme. But the database on Aviation Safety Network (ASN) shows that at least 10 planes crashed in different locations in South Sudan between 2018 and 2020, which caused about 30 fatalities. --BBC--
