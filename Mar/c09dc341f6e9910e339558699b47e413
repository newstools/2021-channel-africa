Agricultural and Marketing Authority (AMA) chief executive Mr Clever Isaya, said yesterday that the Government would maintain the US$1 price per kilogramme and come up with a subsidy. Analysts, however, were quick to point out that the subsidy would come as “an extra huge burden” to the Government already struggling to clear last season’s outstanding payments amounting to $1.5 billion. “The Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement, is looking into that in terms of coming up with a subsidy,” Isaya told The Herald Finance & Business in an interview. Government is already providing subsidy in the form of free inputs. As for outstanding payments, he said: “Whatever is outstanding will be cleared before the onset of the next marketing season.” There are growing concerns that the price, which is way above global price of lint fibre could throw several merchants out of business if the exchange rate remains stable. Cotton firms also indicated they might not afford the price, which is way above the average US40 cents in the region, arguing it would difficult to mobilize finance facilities to pay farmers. --Herald--
