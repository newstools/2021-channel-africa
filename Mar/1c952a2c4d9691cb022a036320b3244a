Social media users had been sharing a video in which the minister exposes her arm as if to receive the injection, but the needle does not actually go in. However, it was later explained that she’d decided to re-enact getting the jab because some reporters said they’d not been able to film her original vaccination. The re-enactment clip was circulated with the misleading claim that she’d not had the vaccine. Dr Aceng posted a video of her actual jab on Twitter, where you can see the needle entering her arm. She urged people to “stop spreading fake news”. The government also called on people to disregard the misleading video in a statement. The NBS TV station, which used the misleading clip in a news report, later apologised and clarified that the minister had been given the vaccination. --BBC--
