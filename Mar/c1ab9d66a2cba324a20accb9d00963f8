Magufuli, 61, is Africa’s most prominent coronavirus sceptic. He has not been seen in public since February 27. Tanzanian opposition leader Tundu Lissu has cited medical and security sources saying the president was flown to the private Nairobi Hospital in neighbouring Kenya and then on to India in a coma. But Tanzania’s ambassador in Windhoek, Modestus Kipilimba, told the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation that was untrue. “For me actually, what I know is that he’s ok, he’s going on with his job,” he told NBC in an interview, without elaborating. Kipilimba’s comments were the first public assessment from a Tanzanian official about Magufuli’s situation since concerns surfaced at the start of this week. 

Kenya’s Nation newspaper on Wednesday cited unidentified political and diplomatic sources saying that an African leader, which it did not name, was being treated for COVID-19 on a ventilator at a private Nairobi Hospital.
