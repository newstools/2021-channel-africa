The 23-year-old was born in London but has eligibility for the Leopards due to his Congolese heritage. He has one appearance for DRC at U-20 level, before changing over to the country of his birth and picking up five caps for England’s U-20 and U-21 teams. Wan-Bissaka, however, has not made an appearance for England’s senior national team, having been forced to withdraw from the squad when he received his only call-up to date in August 2019. The Red Devils star finds himself at the back of a long queue of exceptional right-backs, with the likes of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Kieran Trippier, Reece James and Kyle Walker ahead of him in the pecking order. According to The Athletic, if Wan-Bissaka is not selected for England’s international matches later this month he will move closer to committing his future to the DRC. England manager Southgate is set to name his squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers on March 18, a key date which could see the beginning of Wan-Bissaka switching sides to the Leopards. Wan-Bissaka, formerly of Crystal Palace, has featured 36 times in all competitions with United second in the Premier League. --AllAfrica--
