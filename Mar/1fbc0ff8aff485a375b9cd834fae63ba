Its headline earnings per share slid by 10% to 280.3 cents a share and normalised headline earnings per share was marginally down by 1% to 347.9c. But chief executive Adrian Gore said the group released a strong operating performance against the backdrop of the Covid-19 environment. “We are pleased with the strong performance from all areas of the business established, emerging and new – during a very complicated and uncertain time. The performance of our core businesses has been incredibly robust and our global partnerships through Vitality Group and Ping An Health have delivered exceptional results,” Gore said. He added that despite the Covid19 impacts in the US, John Hancock’s sales from Vitality integrated products outperformed 2019 by 12%, and the election rate for Vitality integrated products over non-Vitality integrated products increased to 50%. The group said the use of these previously established provisions had been relatively low by the end of the reporting period. Looking ahead, Gore said the growth achieved during the past six months reflected the agility of the business. --IOL--
