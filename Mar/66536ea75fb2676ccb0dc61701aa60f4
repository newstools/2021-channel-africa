Federer recorded 13 aces in his first match since initially undergoing surgery on his right knee in February 2020, not long after playing in the 2020 Australian Open. 

The 39-year-old from Switzerland said after the nearly 2 1/2-hour match that it hasn’t been an easy path back to the court. “It has been a long and tough road for me. I enjoyed it, though,” Federer, the 20-time Grand Slam champion, said afterward. “It has been a huge challenge of mine in my tennis career, and to come back at my age is not something that is very simple.” Federer will next face Georgian Nikoloz Basilashvili, who defeated Tunisia’s Malek Jaziri 6-2, 6-2. Top-seeded Dominic Thiem of Austria advanced with a 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-2 win over Russia’s Aslan Karatsev. Among other seeded players to win were Russia’s Andrey Rublev (number three), Canada’s Denis Shapovalov (number four) and Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut (number five). American Taylor Fritz upset sixth-seeded Belgian David Goffin 6-1, 5-7, 7-6 (9). Denmark’s Holger Vitus Nodskov Rune converted 82.4% of his first-serve points while rolling to a 6-2, 6-3 upset of second-seeded Frenchman Benoit Paire at Santiago, Chile. The 17-year-old Rune, ranked 410th in the world, faced very little trouble while prevailing in 61 minutes.
