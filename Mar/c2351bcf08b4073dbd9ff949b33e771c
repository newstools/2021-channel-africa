The schools were scheduled to reopen on Monday but will remain closed "for safety reasons", the state government said. It directed schoolchildren and teachers in the affected schools to remain at home until when an announcement will be made. "The government remains committed to fairness, pluralism, and respect for the law and rights of every citizen at all times," it said in a statement. Local media say the crux of the controversy revolves on the right of schoolchildren to wear hijabs in public schools. The Christian missions reportedly want the government to revert control of the schools that they founded back to them, and have insisted they will not allow pupils to wear hijabs. --BBC--
