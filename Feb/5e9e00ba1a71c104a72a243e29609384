This is the second time in a week that the West Africa country has experienced hours of shutdown in communication services. Last week, the State-owned telecommunications company, Gamtel, apologised to consumers for the failure of the country's main cable, Africa Coast to Europe and backup links which it said was beyond its control. It is uncertain how long the internet blackout will last this time. --BBC--
