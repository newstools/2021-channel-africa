Nadal's bid for an outright men's record 21st Grand Slam continued with a 6-1 6-4 6-2 win over American qualifier Michael Mmoh on Rod Laver Arena. British number three Norrie eventually beat Russia's Roman Safiullin to reach the last 32 for the first time. After a long rain delay, Norrie clinched a 3-6 7-5 6-3 7-6 (7-3) win.  

Norrie looked tight as he failed to serve out a landmark victory at 6-5, but regained his composure to win a tense fourth-set tie-break and tee up a first career-meeting with Nadal. The Briton roared in celebration after landing a first serve which Safiullin could only return into the net on the first of his three match points. When told Nadal had also clinched victory a few minutes earlier, Norrie replied: "Sweet. For someone like me, I don't think about the draw but I saw yesterday he was next to me. "I've never played him before so it will be a great match, a great experience. I can't wait to show him what I've got."
