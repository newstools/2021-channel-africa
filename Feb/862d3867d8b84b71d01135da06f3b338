The carmaker said it will invest $1 billion to convert its vehicle assembly plant in Cologne, Germany, to become the US automaker’s first electric vehicle facility in Europe. Ford said its first European-built, all-electric passenger vehicle will be produced at the facility from 2023 and is considering building a second model there.

The number two US automaker said that by 2026 it will have electric versions of all its passenger cars on sale in Europe and that by 2030 two, thirds of its commercial vehicle sales in Europe will be fully electric or plug-in hybrids. Ford currently dominates the US and European markets for gasoline-powered commercial vehicles with shares of 40% and almost 15%, respectively. The carmaker said its commercial vehicle business is “key to future growth and profitability” and will rely on new products, service and on Ford’s strategic alliance with Volkswagen AG
