Ethiopia was open to possible donations of vaccines, Lia added, and said the country was not doing any procurement of doses independently but only through the COVAX facility.

“For now up to April we have been allocated close to 9 million doses,” Lia Tadesse said. “Within this year we want to make sure we get at least 20% of the population,” she told Reuters. COVAX is co-led by the GAVI alliance which secures vaccines for poor countries, the World Health Organisation, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the United Nations Children’s Fund. African countries are trying to obtain Covid-19 vaccine supplies for their 1.3 billion people even as rich nations elsewhere in the world race ahead with mass immunisation campaigns. Only a handful of nations on the continent have begun administering vaccines. On Tuesday, Lia did not specify which vaccines Ethiopia will be receiving through COVAX. “We are not getting any specific vaccine we are getting them based on the availability of the COVAX facility,” she told Reuters. The health ministry said on Tuesday the country will need $328 million for vaccines and related expenses, the State-run Ethiopian News Agency said, which will be covered by the government and international donations. --Reuters--
