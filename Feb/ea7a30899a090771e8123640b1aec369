The world’s second-largest brewer, which makes Europe’s top selling lager Heineken as well as Tiger and Sol, said it would save $2.4 billion over the three years to 2023 under CEO Dolf van den Brink’s “EverGreen” plan. Savings will be achieved by redesigning its organisation, reducing the complexity and number of its products and identifying its least effective spending, Heineken said. The review of its operations will result in about 8000 job losses, equating to 9% of its workforce at the end of 2019. The brewer said ongoing restrictions on social gatherings and hospitality venues meant 2021 revenue, operating profit and operating profit margin would be below levels in 2019. It expects market conditions to improve gradually in 2021 and more into 2022, with a slow recovery in European bars and restaurants, less than 30% of which were open at the end of January.
