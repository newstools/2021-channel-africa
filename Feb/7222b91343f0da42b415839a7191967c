He is facing terrorism charges with 20 others and his lawyers have in the past denied the charges. Rusesabagina, a critic of President Paul Kagame, is accused of supporting the activities of the National Liberation Forces (FLN), which is the militant wing of his Rwandan Movement for Democratic Change (MRCD) party. He was arrested in August 2020 while in the United Arab Emirates and taken back to Rwanda to face various charges including terrorism, kidnap and murder. The United States and the European Union (EU) Parliament have criticised his detention and the charges he faces. The EU Parliament described the manner of his arrest as "kidnap" and urged the Rwandan authorities to uphold his rights as an EU citizen. --BBC--
