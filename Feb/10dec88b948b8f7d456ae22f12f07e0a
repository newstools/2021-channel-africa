Nigeria's Information Minister added that the protest, risked being "hijacked by hoodlums". Protesters were shot on October 20 allegedly by soldiers at the toll gate in the affluent Lekki district of Lagos. Rights group Amnesty International says at least 12 protesters were killed in Lekki and another district. The military and police have since denied involvement. Nationwide protests against police brutality were largely peaceful until the October 20 shooting, which sparked some of the worst civil unrest since the 1999 return to civilian rule in Africa's most populous country. A judicial commission in Lagos is looking into the allegations that the army and police opened fire on protesters. --Reuters--
