L’Oreal’s shares were up 1.2% in early session trading, among the best performers on France’s benchmark CAC-40 index. The French group reported late on Thursday that sales had reached €7.88 billion ($9.5 billion) in the October to December period, flat from a year earlier on a reported basis but a rise of 4.8% on a like-for-like basis, without currency effects and acquisitions, beating forecasts. “L’Oréal’s industry outperformance demonstrates the power of its well diversified and high-quality brand portfolio,” wrote investment bank Jefferies, which kept a “hold” rating on the stock. --Reuters--
