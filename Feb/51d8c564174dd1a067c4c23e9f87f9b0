Livingstone, 27, has not played a T20 international since 2017 but is recalled after impressing for Perth Scorchers in the Australian Big Bash. There is still no place for Alex Hales, who finished as top run-scorer in the Big Bash with Sydney Thunder. "It's an exciting time for Liam. He's a dynamic cricketer," said national selector Ed Smith. Jofra Archer, Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes are included, but Test captain Joe Root misses out. Pace bowler Jake Ball and spinner Matt Parkinson will travel as reserve players. The five-match series will form part of England's build up to the Twenty20 World Cup, which takes place in India later this year. The squad travel to India on February 26, with the first match in Ahmedabad on March 12. --BBC--
