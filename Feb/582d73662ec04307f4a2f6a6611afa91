Around 100 demonstrators were dispersed, with police pictured approaching some on horses. The protestors' slogan was "45 years is too much" - a criticism of the ruling party, the MPLA, which has ruled since Angola gained independence from Portugal. It follows a string of anti-government protests that gained momentum over the second half of 2020. --BBC--
