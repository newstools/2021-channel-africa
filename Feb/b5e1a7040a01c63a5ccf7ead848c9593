It is not clear whether the murder was politically motivated. The assailants took mobile phones and wallets before they fled the scene. No arrests have been made. Bamporiki was the Co-ordinator of the Rwanda National Congress. Party Spokesperson, Etienne Mutabazi, told the BBC that a client had made contact with Bamporiki, who runs a bed shop, asking if he had a bed to sell. The client then asked for the bed to be delivered in Nyanga township and drove with Bamporiki and his associate to the area where the bed was supposed to have been delivered. The details of what happened thereafter are yet to be confirmed, but Bamporiki was killed by a single shot fired through the window of the vehicle. Nyanga township is known to be one of the most dangerous townships in South Africa. At some point it had the highest murder rate per annum. --BBC--
