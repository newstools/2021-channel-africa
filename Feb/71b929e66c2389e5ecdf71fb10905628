President Denis Sassou Nguesso will face seven challengers including the former Finance Minister, Mathias Dzon, and Guy-Brice Parfait Kolelas, the son of a former Prime Minister. The 77-year-old Sassou Nguesso is seeking a fourth term. He has been in power since 1979, except for a five-year period after losing elections in 1992. Others in the presidential race are Albert Oniangue, a former aide-de-camp of Sassou Nguesso, Joseph Kignoumbi Kia Mbougou, a former member of parliament, Anguios Nganguia Engambe, customs official, member of parliament Michel Mboussi Ngouari and Deve Mafoula, a 38-year-old aspirant. The largest opposition group, the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy, has said it will boycott the polls. The constitution was changed in a referendum in 2015 to remove term and age limits. Sassou Nguesso's victory in 2016 was marred by violence and claims of fraud. --BBC--
