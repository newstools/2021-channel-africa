The vote is expected to confirm the shift of power in favour of President Félix Tshisekedi, in his power struggle with his predecessor Joseph Kabila. President Tshisekedi’s newly acquired majority, composed of 391 MPs out of 500, has lined up candidates for the top positions in parliament. The new speaker will replace Jeanine Mabunda, a Kabila ally who was voted out on December 10. The vote on the speaker and members of his office will expedite the appointment of a new prime minister, the president's allies say. --BBC--
