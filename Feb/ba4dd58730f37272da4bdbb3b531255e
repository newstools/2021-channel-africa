The second-largest United States (US) automaker identified 144 340 US 2004 to 2006 Ford Ranger trucks and about 8,800 in Canada that could have obsolete Takata parts.

Ford said it could not locate 45 inflators that could have been installed and was recalling all of the vehicles “at the request of the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration” (NHTSA).  

Ford also said on Thursday it was separately recalling a group of 1 100 vehicles from the 2004 to 2011 model years that may also have had obsolete Takata service parts.  

Last month, Ford said it would comply with an earlier NHTSA request to recall three million vehicles with potentially defective driver-side Takata air bags and would take a $610 million charge.

NHTSA rejected a formal petition from Ford to avoid a recall.
