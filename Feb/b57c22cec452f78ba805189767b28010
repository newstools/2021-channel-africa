World number one Djokovic was hampered by a side injury that restricted his movement, although he still recorded a 7-6 (7-1) 6-4 3-6 4-6 6-2 victory. Djokovic is set to meet 14th seed Milos Raonic in the next round, but said: "I know it's a tear and I don't know if I will recover from that in two days. I don't know if I will step on court." The Serb, who is chasing a record-extending ninth men's singles title in Melbourne and a third in a row, added: "This is one of the most special wins in my life. "It doesn't matter who I was up against or at what round, to pull this through is something I will remember for ever. "In the third and fourth set I just served and couldn't do much with the returns. I was just putting in two first serves. "I just tried to stay in there. I was hoping that whatever was happening was going to feel better and towards the end of the fourth it started to feel better."
