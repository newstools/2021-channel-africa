Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Governor Dr John Mangudya, is expected to present this year’s monetary policy statement any time from this week going forward. In an interview with our Bulawayo Bureau, TIMB chief executive officer Dr Andrew Matibiri, said nothing regards the payment modalities for this year’s tobacco crop has been made. “We are still waiting for the Reserve Bank to decid, at the moment we don’t know. I think maybe in about a week’s time we would know,” he said. “I think we are waiting for the monetary policy statement first, but it’s due sometime this week.” Last year, tobacco farmers were paid half their earnings through their Zimbabwe dollar accounts with the remaining half being deposited into their Foreign Currency Accounts. However, most farmers faced difficulties in accessing their hard currency due to failure to appreciate the processes involved. It is believed that announcing the payment system ahead of the opening of the selling season gives impetus to the way tobacco growers prepare their crop for the market as they need to plan for payments to many service providers that they dealt with throughout the cropping season.  --Herald--
