State Security Minister Owen Ncube, as well as the Heads of the police, the intelligence agency and the former Chief of the presidential guard, will have any assets in the United Kingdom (UK) frozen. They'll also be banned from visiting. The UK referred to the killing of protesters during post-election violence in 2018, and unrest in January the following year. In a tweet, Zimbabwe's government Spokesperson, Nick Mangwana, said none of the officials targeted had any assets in the UK or had any intention of travelling there. --BBC--
