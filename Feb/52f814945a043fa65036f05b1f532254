Janet Museveni, Minister of Education and sports in a statement said learners in pre-primary school cannot strictly adhere to COVID-19 prevention measures. "The pre-primary schools shall not be reopened for the time being. The pre-primary school pupils do not wear masks in accordance to health guidelines," said Museveni. "Pre-primary schools are day and there is a lot of interaction between the schools and parents and there is direct and close supervision of learners by teachers and this means that there is increased risk of infection," she added. She noted that there is high incidence of upper respiratory infections among learners in this age category. "We must all agree to leave all pre-primary schools closed throughout the COVID-19 season," the Minister said. Meanwhile school for semi-candidates and all tertiary and university students will reopen on March 1 in a phased manner, according to the Ministry of Education. In March last year, the country closed all schools and education institutions to curb the spread of COVID-19. On October 15, Uganda reopened schools for about 1.3 million candidates and tertiary and university finalists to complete their studies. As of Wednesday, Uganda registered 39 735 cases of COVID-19, with 14 310 recoveries and 327 deaths, according to the Ministry of Health. --Xinhua--
