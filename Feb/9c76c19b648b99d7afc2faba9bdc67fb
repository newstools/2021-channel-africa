The defeat ended Williams’ bid for a record-equalling 24 Grand Slam title. “It was a big error day for me today,” the 39-year-old told reporters after the match at Rod Laver Arena. Asked if it was just a bad day at the office, Williams said: “I don’t know. I am done,” before leaving the room in tears.
