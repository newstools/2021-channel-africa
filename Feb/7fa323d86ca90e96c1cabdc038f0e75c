The Reds fell 13 points behind league leaders Manchester City this past weekend following a 3-1 defeat at Leicester City on Saturday. Salah opened the scoring for Liverpool at King Power Stadium, but goals from James Maddison, Jamie Vardy and Harvey Barnes in seven devastating minutes sealed a comprehensive win for the Foxes. Defeat resulted in manager Jurgen Klopp conceding that his club’s hopes of defending the Premier League title are all but over following a third straight defeat, but Salah hasn’t given up just yet. “It’s been a tough period for many reasons. We are champions and we will fight like champions, until the very end,” the Egyptian winger wrote on Twitter. “We will not allow this season to be defined by the recent results we’ve had. That is my promise to all of you.” Salah, 28, has scored 17 goals in 23 Premier League appearances this season and currently tops the scoring charts. --AllAfrica--
