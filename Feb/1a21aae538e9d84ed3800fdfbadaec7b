Continental Europe’s oldest national Open, first played in 1906, will have a prize fund of 1.5 million euros ($1.81 million) and will be played for the 19th consecutive occasion at Le Golf National, near Paris. The European Tour and the French Golf Federation (FFG) have held talks with government authorities with the intention of staging the event without spectators. The event will be the fourth tournament in a five-week spring stretch on European soil between the first two major championships of 2021 -- the Masters Tournament and US PGA Championship. “As well as being part of a travel-friendly run in Europe at that time of the year, the tournament also helps us celebrate the wonderful heritage of the national Opens on the European Tour,” European Tour chief executive Keith Pelley said. --Reuters--
