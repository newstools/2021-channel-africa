A plane carrying 600 000 doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine landed in the capital, Accra, on Wednesday, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Unicef said. "These 600 000 Covax vaccines are part of an initial tranche of deliveries ... which represent part of the first wave of Covid vaccines headed to several low and middle-income countries," a statement said. Ghana's Ministry of Information said priority will be given to health workers, the elderly above 60 years and people with underlying health conditions. Others to receive the shots are selected members of the executive, legislature, judiciary and their related staff, front line security personnel, some religious leaders, essential workers and teachers. The delivery of the vaccine doses comes amid talk about rich nations purchasing excess vaccines and making it harder for poor nations to access any. WHO Director, Tedros Ghebreyesus, earlier said that wealthier nations were undermining the global vaccine distribution initiative by reducing the number of doses it can purchase. --BBC--
