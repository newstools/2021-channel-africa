Namibia's Finance Minister, Iipumbu Shiimi, says the country's economy, can no longer afford to perpetually provide financial support to Air Namibia at the expense of supporting economic growth and critical social services. Air Namibia, which employs 644 workers, is buckling under mountains of debt. It has failed to produce financial statements in recent years despite regular state bailouts over the past two decades. The government estimates it has spent more than $547.16 million on Air Namibia. The government said it would pay Air Namibia's employees the value of one year's salary, over the next 12 months. --Reuters--
