President Nyusi promised that there will be no retaliation against those who surrender and return to their families. He made the pledge on Wednesday as the country paid tribute to its national heroes. The amnesty offer was also extended to citizens who have joined the ranks of a local militant organisation allied to the opposition party, Renamo. Hundreds have been killed by the jihadists in Cabo Delgado, who launched their insurgency in 2017. About 570,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. Terror group Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a string of attacks in Mozambique. President Nyusi urged the militants to take advantage of the ongoing process of disarmament. He also warned that the government could enact restrictive measures amid rising coronavirus cases and promised to address the nation on Thursday on the pandemic. --BBC--
