The Romanian, a finalist in 2018, trailed 5-2 in the deciding set before beating the Australian 4-6 6-4 7-5. A nervy Tomljanovic failed to serve out the match at 5-3 and Halep showed her experience to secure a remarkable win. "In the end I think mentally I was a little bit stronger, had the desire to win the match," she said. In front of a rowdy Margaret Court Arena, Halep cut a frustrated figure, frequently yelling and gesturing at her coach, Darren Cahill. However, when Tomljanovic faltered at the key moment, the two-time Grand Slam champion forced her way through her opponent's defences and shook her fists in celebration at the end. "I am really happy I can smile now," Halep said in her on-court interview. "I was not that positive when I was talking to myself, I was just blaming myself that I am not strong enough to play against her." Halep will play Russia's Veronika Kudermetova next.
