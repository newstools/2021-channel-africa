The attack in Malek area on Sunday left three people dead, four others wounded and one missing, according to a press statement. The motive behind the attack on the polio workers, who were travelling from Rumbek Centre to Rumbek North, remains unclear. UN humanitarian co-ordinator in South Sudan, Alain Noud√©hou, has called for those responsible to be brought to justice. The nationwide polio vaccination campaign started on Tuesday. It is the second round of vaccination since an outbreak in September last year. It is targeting children under five years old in 10 regional states. --BBC--
