In a rematch of their tumultuous 2018 United States (US) Open decider, Osaka underlined her status as the new queen of women’s tennis and soaked up the cheers from the Rod Laver Arena crowd as fans returned to the Grand Slam after a five-day lockdown. “It’s just always an honour to play her and I just didn’t want to go out really dud. I just wanted to try my best,” Osaka said after her 75-minute match on a steamy afternoon. “I was a little kid watching her play and just to be on the court playing against her is a dream.” Osaka, the 2019 champion, will meet Jennifer Brady, who ensured there would be at least one American in the final after battling to a 6-4 3-6 6-4 win over Karolina Muchova in the other semi on Thursday. It will be a rematch of last year’s US Open semi-final, where Osaka edged Brady in three sets on the way to her third Grand Slam triumph. Williams, however, exited in tears after an error-strewn match and with a question mark over her future. The 39-year-old, who returned to the tour in 2018 after taking time away from the game to give birth to daughter Alexis Olympia, cut her post-match news conference short when she broke down after being asked whether it was a bad day at the office.
