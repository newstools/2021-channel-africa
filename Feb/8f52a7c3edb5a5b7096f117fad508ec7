At least 60 peasant families have complained of damage in the district of Mocuba. Local official, Florentino Cardoso, said farmers had been told to spray their farms with insecticides and to use other mechanical means to combat the pests. The district government is already on the ground to deal with the situation that threatens to jeopardise corn production. About 763 tonnes of cereals are expected to be harvested this season. The corn fennel caterpillar is a pest whose main host is the maize crop. --BBC--
