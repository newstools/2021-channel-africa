The United States golfing champion was driving alone on a Los Angeles downhill stretch of road known for crashes. His SUV hit the central reservation, crossed into the opposite lane, rolled over several times and then plunged off the road and down an embankment. He is recovering after surgery to his fractured leg and shattered ankle. "A reckless driving charge has a lot of elements into it, this is purely an accident," Los Angeles County Sheriff, Alex Villanueva, told reporters. There no evidence Woods was impaired by drugs or alcohol, he added. "He was not drunk," he said on Wednesday. "We can throw that one out." He added the most Woods could face would be a low-level offence known as an infraction if investigators concluded that he was speeding or not paying attention, the AFP news agency reports. Woods underwent surgery on his leg after he was removed from the wreck of his car by firefighters and paramedics. He suffered fractures on the tibia and fibula bones in his lower right leg. Injuries to his foot and ankle have been stabilised with screws and pins. On Wednesday, Villanueva said of the road where the accident happened: "Because it is downhill, it slopes and curves, that area has a high frequency of accidents. It is not uncommon." He said the car hit a kerb, a tree and rolled over several times. Woods, who had been recovering from a fifth round of back surgery in January, was in Los Angeles to host last week's Genesis Invitational PGA Tour event and was driving one of the tournament cars when he crashed. --BBC--
