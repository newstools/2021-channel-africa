PGM includes platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, ruthenium and gold. According to the group, the increase was largely due to higher 4E built-up head grade and higher throughput. Platinum production increased by 6% to 24 600 ounces while palladium production increased by 10% to 22 000 ounces. At overall group level, total PGM production of 1 076 100 ounces was achieved which was a decrease of 7% against Q4 2019, with safety controls and restrictions remaining in place to protect employees from Covid-19. Platinum and palladium production was down 6%to 497 800 ounces and 338 400 ounces respectively. Similarly, total PGM sales volumes decreased 24% to 1 125 100 ounces largely due to lower refined production. The decline was offset by a draw-down of refined inventory and trading activities to mitigate the impact to customers. Chief Executive Natascha Viljoen, said the company is now operating at 90% of its normal production capacity because the second wave of Covid-19 has led to an increase in employee infections. “We had no work-related fatalities at our own-managed operations during the quarter, however, we did see a regression in our safety performance as the uncertainty relating to Covid-19 impacted on stability at the operations. “Production performance was strong considering the on-going implications of Covid-19. While refined production was lower, we successfully and safely completed the rebuild of the ACP Phase A unit ahead of schedule and recommissioned the plant on November 24, 2020. We were able to reduce the impact of lower refined production on sales by drawing down on refined inventory as well as utilising trading activities to mitigate the impact to customers,” said in an update for the quarter. Figures from the group show that PGM production at own-managed mines decreased by 8% to 617 800 ounces due to the closure of mined-out infrastructure at Amandelbult and community-related disruptions at Mogalakwena. Unki and Mototolo delivered strong production. Joint operations PGM production (mined and purchase of concentrate) decreased by 14% to 198 000 ounces. --Herald--
