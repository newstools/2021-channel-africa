Barty played with her left thigh heavily strapped in her second round win over fellow Australian Daria Gavrilova but downplayed the injury on Thursday, saying she was “fit as a fiddle.” She and American Jennifer Brady were scheduled to play in the second round of the women’s doubles on Friday but withdrew from the match, handing Elise Mertens and Aryna Sabalenka a walkover. Top seed Barty, who made the semi-finals in 2020, is bidding to end Australia’s 43-year wait for a home winner at the Grand Slam. --Reuters--
