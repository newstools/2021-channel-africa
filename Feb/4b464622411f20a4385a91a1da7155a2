He also warned that the utility will post a substantial net after-tax loss at its next financial results. De Ruyter was hosted by the free market foundation on its podcast to discuss Eskom’s current state of affairs. He says some power stations are old and unreliable and the power utility has to launch a reliability maintenance recovery programme. The programme is intended to catch up on the backlog of maintenance. De Ruyter says once the programme is complete, the risk of load shedding will decrease but not entirely eliminate the blackouts. He further admits that the power utility’s income statement is still under pressure, warning that the profit reported in the first half of the financial year will not be sustained.
