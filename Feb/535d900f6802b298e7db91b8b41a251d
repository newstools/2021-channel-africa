With public opinion at home fiercely against the deployment in the Sahel while also eyeing re-election, Macron is seeking support to cut troop numbers. The meeting comes a year after France boosted its Sahel deployment, seeking to take back momentum in the brutal, long-running insurgency. But despite touted military successes, militants remain in control of vast swathes of territory and attacks are unrelenting. Six United Nations (UN) peacekeepers have been killed in Mali this year alone, and France has lost five soldiers since December. Islamist fighters in the Sahel first emerged in northern Mali in 2012, during a rebellion by ethnic Touareg separatists which was later overtaken by the jihadists. France intervened to rout the insurgents, but the fighters scattered, taking their campaign into central Mali and then into Burkina Faso and Niger. Thousands of soldiers and civilians have been killed, according to the UN, while more than two million people have fled their homes. The crushing toll has fuelled perceptions that the insurgency cannot be defeated by military means alone. Last Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called for a diplomatic, political and development surge to respond to the situation. Last year, France upped its Barkhane mission in the Sahel from 4 500 troops to 5 100, a move that precipitated a string of apparent military successes. French forces killed the leader of the notorious Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Abdelmalek Droukdel, as well as a military chief of the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Group to Support Islam and Muslims. But the latest attacks have also brought the number of French combat deaths in Mali to 50. Macron last month opened the door to a drawdown, suggesting France may adjust its military commitment. Despite persistent rumours, France is not expected to announce any troop withdrawal at N'Djamena. --AfricaNews--
