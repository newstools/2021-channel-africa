This, in spite of curfews and international flight limitations, said Ctrack SA Managing Director, Hein Jordt. He was commenting on the Ctrack Freight and Transport Index for December 2020, which had declined by less than 2% compared to December 2019, which was an indication of economic recovery of the trade and transport of goods. For the fourth quarter of 2020 the index was up 5.3% over to the third quarter. Jordt said that in South Africa, airfreight had received no government aid during the lockdown, space was at a premium as there were fewer flights, and prices rose by 200-300%. “The improvement of air freight in the final quarter as measured by Ctrack of 30.6% is nothing short of a miracle. This is amazing if one takes into account there was less international travel and fewer scheduled flights and shows the resilience of this sector,” he said. He said however further recovery in 2021 of airfreight was expected to be slow, as passenger air traffic was still far below normal levels, and this was likely to continue for some time. Airfreight comprises only 2% of the freight that crosses the border by weight, compared to the 60% of sea freight, however air freight makes up about 30% of the value of cross-border trade. He said it did seem that an increasing number of cargo planes were taking to the skies. About 80 aircraft had been dedicated to the worldwide vaccine roll-out. While the index showed an economy returning to normal, the government needed to ease restrictions on sectors such as travel, for the industry to show further recovery, said Jordt. The Ctrack Freight and Transport index was still tracking 5.6% below its 2019 high and 7% below its all-time high early in 2018. On a quarter-to-quarter basis storage grew by 13.1%. The growth in storage was attributed to a less than perfect Black November retail campaign that resulted in a surplus of retail goods and supply chain disruption fears. --IOL--
