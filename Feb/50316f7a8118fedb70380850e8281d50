The base near the town of Douentza in was attacked, a spokesperson for the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission (MINUSMA), Olivier Salgado, told Reuters. He did not say who was responsible. Islamist militant groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic States regularly attack UN peacekeepers and Malian soldiers in the area. “The MINUSMA chief firmly condemns the attack and has ordered that all measures be taken to treat the wounded,” Salgado said. Deployed since 2013, the UN currently has over 14 000 peacekeepers in Mali.
