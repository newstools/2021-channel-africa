The commission will probe Woolworths, Pick n Pay, Shoprite, Spar, Food Lover's Market, Cambridge Foods, and Boxers stores, the state news agency reports. The probe was launched after various complaints by members of the public. Garlic and ginger have often been mentioned as natural remedies against common cold and other illnesses. The consumer commission has urged the public to be on the lookout for other stores hiking prices of these and other goods and report them for action. Those found guilty of increasing prices of goods could be fined or imprisoned in accordance with the local laws. --BBC--
