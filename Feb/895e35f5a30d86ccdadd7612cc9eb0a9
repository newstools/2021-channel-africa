US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dipped 3 cents to $60.02 a barrel at 0510 GMT, retreating from a 13-month high of $60.95 hit on Tuesday. Brent crude futures gained 11 cents, or 0.2%, to $63.46 a barrel, adding to three days of gains. Oil prices have run up strongly in recent months and supply disruptions caused by a historic winter storm in Texas, the country’s largest oil producing state, continued to keep prices supported, analysts said. ANZ and Citigroup analysts estimated at least two million barrels per day (bpd) of US shale oil production has been curtailed. Citi estimated a cumulative production loss of around 16 million barrels through early March. But the extreme cold has also hit crude demand due to disruptions to refinery operations. Chevron Corp’s 112.229 barrel-per-day (bpd) Houston-area refinery in Pasadena, Texas, was shut on Tuesday, the company said. --Reuters--
