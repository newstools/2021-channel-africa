The First Lady is the country’s Health and Child Care Ambassador. Last year, she taught people how to keep the disease at bay and mobilised resources for the benefit of marginalised communities. Mnangagwa helped some women start clubs to sew reusable face masks as part of her multi-pronged efforts to ensure everyone benefited. She met disadvantaged groups like the physically handicapped, previously marginalised communities and the less-privileged as part of her mission to ensure no one was left behind. Both rural and urban communities benefited from the awareness campaigns during which efforts were made to bridge some knowledge gaps and ensure everyone had access to information on the pandemic. 

The government of Zimbabwe has imposed some lockdowns to curtail the spread of the coronavirus, therefore, I urge you all to continue following measures outlined by health experts and as Ambassador for Health and Child Care, it is my desire for the country’s citizens to lead healthy lives,” she said. --Herald--
