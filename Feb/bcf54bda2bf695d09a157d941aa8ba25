The Lions are due to visit South Africa in July and August with a three-Test series against the world champions. But issues around Covid-19, including the emergence of a new variant in South Africa, have led to uncertainty over the viability of the tour. "We're here to help," Rugby Australia Chairperson, Hamish McLennan, told the Sydney Morning Herald. "What we learnt from the Tri Nations in 2020 and the tennis that's happening now is that Australia can successfully stage global tournaments in a Covid world. "It's particularly tough in the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa at the moment and I believe the more international rugby that gets played here, the better." McLennan says profits from the tour would be split between the Lions and South Africa, with Rugby Australia covering their costs. The Lions board have been discussing contingency plans in the event the trip has to be abandoned, including the possibility of hosting games in the UK and Ireland. Crowds have returned to watch live sport in Australia, with up to 30 000 fans allowed to watch March's Australian Open in Melbourne. --BBC--
