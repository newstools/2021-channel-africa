The plane carrying 11 000 World Health Organisation vaccines was unable to land at the Conakry-Gebessia International Airport on Sunday because of bad weather conditions. The plane was forced to divert to Dakar in Senegal. Guinea's Health Ministry said on Facebook that they planned to fly the supplies from Dakar on Monday and start the vaccination roll out one day late on Tuesday. It is unclear whether it was possible for the Monday flight to take place. Guinean health authorities confirmed on February 14 the resurgence of the Ebola epidemic in the country. The new cases were reported in Gouecke, in the southeastern prefecture of N'Zerekore where at least six people have died. --BBC--
