UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, said she had received reports of serious human rights violations and abuses by the parties to the conflict in the northern Tigray region and their allies. "We were not speaking about just the Tigray region itself, although the fighting is going on, but we also have reports from other areas," she told the BBC's Newsday programme. "Atrocity crimes don't happen overnight. There are root causes, there are processes and triggers and right now what we need is for the Ethiopian government to establish rule of law and an impartial investigation to be held to ensure accountability for serious violations," she added. --BBC--
