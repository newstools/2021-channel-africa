The cause of the fires is unclear, but Tigray has been hit by conflict since November between Ethiopian-led troops and forces allied with the region's ousted ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front. Images collected by private satellite operator Planet Labs on Sunday and Tuesday and analysed by security research organisation, DX Open Network, showed that at least 508 structures appeared to have been destroyed by fire around Gijet and three nearby settlements, Reuters reported. They are about 35 kilometres south-west of the regional capital Mekelle. DX Open Network had concluded that the fires were "intentional", and not the result of fighting, Reuters added. --BBC--
