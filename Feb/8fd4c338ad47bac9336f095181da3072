The Japanese car maker decided in 2016 to build the vehicle in Britain in what was seen as a key vote of confidence just months after the Brexit referendum raised uncertainty over its trading relationship with the European Union. On Christmas Eve last year London and Brussels struck an agreement that allows for tariff-free trade as long as local content thresholds are met. Nissan said in January it would source more batteries in Britain as a result, and on Thursday its Europe boss Gianlucca de Fichy told reporters it planned further investment. “We’ve invested over millionso far in our English factory, and we are planning over the coming years to exceed the 1 billion investment mark, including due to the introduction of e-Power which will come to market soon,” he said. Asked about cross-manufacturing with alliance partner Renault, de Ficchy said Nissan was working closely with the French automaker.
