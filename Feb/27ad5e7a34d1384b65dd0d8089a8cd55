Brazilian star Neymar is in discussions with PSG over a possible new contract, as his current deal is set to end in June 2022. "I am very happy at the moment, things have changed a lot," the 28-year-old told French television channel TF1. "I can't really say why. I feel good, I have adapted, I'm calmer. I'm very happy here. I want to stay at PSG." Neymar, who PSG made the world's most expensive player with a €222 million ($269 million) transfer from Barcelona in 2017, scored twice in Sunday's surprise 3-2 loss at Lorient, the club's first defeat under new coach Mauricio Pochettino. He wants Mbappe – who has been repeatedly linked with a possible move to Real Madrid and said he wanted time to "think" earlier this month – to sign a new deal. "I hope Kylian will want to stay too," Neymar added. "Of course, that's the wish of all the supporters. "We want Paris to remain a great team and I want to keep doing what I've always done – playing football and being happy, they're the most important things." Mbappe has scored 16 goals in all competitions this season for PSG, with Neymar netting 13 times despite having a long spell out of the team with injury. "We have a relationship like brothers," Neymar said of the 22-year-old Mbappe. "I'm the older one. We like to play together a lot. I love to bring the best out of him. "He's a golden boy, I call him 'Golden Boy' because he really is golden. He has a huge heart, even off the pitch he is incredible." Sunday's defeat saw PSG slip to the unusually low position of third in Ligue 1, three points behind leaders Lille. --AFP--
