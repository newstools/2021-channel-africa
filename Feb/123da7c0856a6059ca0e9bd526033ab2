Liverpool moved up to third place on the league standings thanks to Salah’s two stunning goals which inspired the team to a 3-1 win over West Ham United on Sunday evening. “It’s a good win for us today. We play away for the second game in a row and you need to win every game now,” Salah told the club’s official website. “It’s a tough team, to be fair, they play a really good game. I think I scored a few goals against them but it’s a tough team. They are in a good position this season. So, we just need to carry on and keep winning.” Salah opened the scoring with a brilliant curling effort inside a crowded penalty area, before finishing off a brilliant team move to seal the Reds’ win. The 28-year-old, who is sitting at the top of the Premier League goal scoring charts with 15 goals, discussed his second goal. “I just keep practising in training for my right foot and left foot. But it was a good ball from Xherdin Shaqiri Shaq,” he said. “I have to give him credit as well for the lovely ball from him. I just kept the first touch and the second was the finish.” It’s back-to-back wins for Liverpool as they successfully followed up Thursday’s win at Tottenham Hotspur. Salah believes consistency is now required from the Reds until the end of the season if they are to keep hold of the Premier League title. Liverpool will host Brighton Hove and Albion on Wednesday at the Anfield Stadium where they will also face Manchester City on Sunday.  --AllAfrica--
