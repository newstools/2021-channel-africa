South Africa’s decision on Sunday to suspend plans to roll out AstraZeneca’s vaccine, after data showed it may not offer sufficient protection against the country’s dominant coronavirus variant, has only added to Sicina’s concerns. “We do not trust these politicians,” he said. Many South Africans agree. The Indaba nurses union, to which Sicina belongs, has advised its 17 000 members to boycott the vaccine. Two polls, a global one by IPSOS and a national one by South African fintech start-up CompariSure, in January suggested that half of South Africans would refuse the vaccine. 

A University of Johannesburg (UJ) survey, with the biggest sample size of 10 000, put the number more optimistically at a third. The stakes are high: Covid-19 has hit South Africa harder than anywhere else on the continent, infecting nearly 1.5 million and killing more than 46 000 while a more infectious variant that evolved here has spread around the world. South Africa hopes to vaccinate 40 million people, or two-thirds of the population, to achieve some herd immunity but has yet to administer a shot.
