Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, rose 0.7% in the 12 months to January, up from 0.6% in December, the Office for National Statistics said. Food prices pushed up costs, along with household goods. The rise was slightly higher than many economists' forecasts. Jonathan Athow, Deputy National Statistician for Economic Statistics, said household goods prices were higher because there had been less discounting on items such as bedding or sofas, but January discounting had continued in some form: "However, there were widespread January sales, with particular price cuts for clothing and footwear." --BBC--
