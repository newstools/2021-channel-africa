Over the weekend, scores of people protested at beaches in Cape Town, calling for them to be re-opened. The organisers accused the government of “being unconstitutional” for closing the beaches. Law-enforcement officers dispersed the crowds but did not make any arrests. The group has threatened more gatherings, something that has concerned opposition parties in the Western Cape. Officials of the Economic Freedom Fighters party in the province have called for an investigation into the protests and for arrests to follow. Meanwhile, two church associations have gone to court to sue President Cyril Ramaphosa and some of his ministers for the closure of churches. They claim that the decision was unfair, especially since some businesses, such as cinemas, are still allowed to operate if they have safety measures in place. Behind the scenes, Ramaphosa’s cabinet is trying to reach a consensus on the current health regulations to address concerns raised by various stakeholders on their economic impact. The president is expected to give an address on those discussions on Monday evening - there is widespread speculation that this will include the lifting of the ban on alcohol sales. --BBC--
