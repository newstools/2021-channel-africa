Increased demand for goods like furniture, exercise equipment and home improvement goods from shoppers sheltering at home during the pandemic has triggered a spike in shipping rates, boosting Maersk’s earnings. Maersk’s ocean shipping business, its largest division, “performed at record level in the quarter as a consequence of the strong rebound of demand,” Chief Executive Officer, Soren Skou, said in a statement. “Our continued progress makes us confident that we will continue to grow the earnings of the company as the economic situation normalises in 2021 and beyond,” Skou said. The world’s largest container shipping line, Maersk said it expects earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) before restructuring and integration costs of $8.5 billion-$10.5 billion this year, up from $8.3 billion in 2020. In the fourth quarter in 2020, EBITDA rose 85% to $2.71 billion, beating the 2.68 billion forecast by analysts. --Reuters--
