The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up 0.3% at 1116 GMT, having touched new peaks earlier in the session. Overnight, MSCI’s ex-Japan Asian shares index also broke above its previous high, in January. European indexes strengthened after a shaky start, with the STOXX 600 up 0.3% and London’s FTSE 100 up 0.4% . The recent gains stem from a combination of the market pricing in increased US fiscal stimulus, as well as some relief that the retail trading frenzy in certain stocks appears to be over in the short-term, said Kiran Ganesh, multi-asset strategist at UBS. “The prospects for fiscal stimulus in the US seem to be getting revised upward. Now, Biden is talking about $1.9 trillion,” he said -- around 9% of US GDP. UBS expects that after negotiations with Republicans the stimulus will come to around $1.5 trillion. “There’s still plenty of excitement to get priced in around the stimulus,” he said. “The path of least resistance still seems to be upward at this stage.”
