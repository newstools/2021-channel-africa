Barty’s decision comes after being knocked out of the Adelaide International on Wednesday, losing 6-3 6-4 to American Danielle Collins in the second round. The 24-year-old Australian was struggling with a left thigh strain throughout the Australian Open, where she bowed out in the quarter-finals last week. “Unfortunately I have withdrawn from the Qatar Total Open with a left leg injury,” Barty said. “I wish the tournament a safe and successful event and hope to play there next year. Thank you to the event organisers and the WTA for all the work you are doing, I look forward to competing again in Miami in a few weeks’ time.” Barty follows world number three, Simona Halep, and 2019 US Open winner Bianca Andreescu, in skipping the Doha event. --Reuters--
