Defender Diego Carlos put Julen Lopetegui's side ahead in the 19th minute, climbing above two defenders to head home a corner from Joan Jordan. Luuk de Jong put the visitors further ahead early in the second half with a backheel to guide a low cross from Munir El Haddadi into the net, while substitute Papu Gomez nearly added a third late on but was denied by keeper Sergio Herrera. It was a welcome victory for Sevilla after their 3-2 home defeat by Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League last-16, first leg last week and saw them move to 48 points, one point ahead of Barca who drew 1-1 at home to Cadiz on Sunday.
