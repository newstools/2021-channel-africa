The shortfall is another blow to the European Union (EU), which has also been hit by delays in vaccine deliveries from Britain-based AstraZeneca Plc and U.S. biotech Moderna Inc. It had also faced earlier delays with the shot from Pfizer. The situation raises questions about the rationale of an EU vaccine export control scheme set up in late January to ensure timely deliveries that has not yet been activated, despite the supply shortfalls. This week, Pfizer delivered to the EU 4.8 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine it developed with German partner BioNTech, according to an EU official who is directly involved in talks with the United States (US) company. That takes the total to about 28 million doses of the two-shot vaccine, one of the EU officials and a source familiar with the matter said. That is still about 10 million doses less than Pfizer had promised to supply since the rollout began late last year, the EU official said. A second EU official involved in talks with vaccine makers confirmed the shortfall but said the companies had committed to delivering those doses by the end of March. Pfizer declined to comment, saying schedules of its deliveries were confidential. The executive European Commission did not respond to a request for comment on delivery shortfalls.
