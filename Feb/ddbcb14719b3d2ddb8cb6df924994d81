The hit was somewhat cushioned by strong demand for immunity-boosting products, which drove an almost 50% surge in profit in the consumer division that accounts for a fourth of the pharmaceutical company’s gross profits. Headline earnings per share (HEPS), the primary measure of profit for South African companies, dropped to 186.5 cents from 218.5 cents in 2020. Turnover for the six months ended December 31 rose 3.6% to R3.76 billion ($257.98 million), helped by its acquisition of homecare products company Plush in March. South Africa’s second-biggest pharma company, which sells products including over-the-counter medication, its own fast-moving consumer goods brands and hospital and critical care products, announced a dividend of 80 cents per share for the period. “The Group will continue to focus on cost control, cash generation and preserve the balance sheet strength, whilst continuing to seek acquisitions to broaden its portfolio,” the company said. --Reuters--
