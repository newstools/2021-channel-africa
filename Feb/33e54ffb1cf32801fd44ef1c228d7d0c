The sector is one of the leading sources of foreign exchange, earning $1.54 billion in 2019, and which had been expected to grow by 1% in 2020. Tourism contributes 10% of Kenyaâ€™s annual GDP and employs over two million people. However, restrictions on travel to combat Covid-19 reduced airline travel and accelerated cancellations of hotel reservations. These measures continue to affect receipts, thereby reducing foreign exchange inflows, and impact service sector-related employment in East African countries with a high dependence on tourism. According to data from Kenya Private Sector Alliance at least 3.1 million jobs in travel and tourism were affected in the year 2020 as hotels, bars and restaurants, tour operators, airlines, travel agents and their suppliers and support services recorded low business. The September 2020 arrivals showed an 84.7% drop compared with the same in 2019 when arrivals for the month closed at 169 574, an increase from 114 539 visitors the same month the previous year. The tourism sector is not likely to recover anytime soon as the Covid-19 situation worsens in the traditional tourism market of the US, the United Kingdom, and large parts of the European Union including Sweden, France and Germany. --TheEastAfrican--
