Blinken urged Abiy to allow humanitarian access to the region to prevent further loss of life. He also pledged the US support for Ethiopia's reforms and elections. Abiy has thanked the US State Secretary for his "commitment to support Ethiopia's deep reforms that we will pursue undeterred. Our aspirations to democratise and build a multidimensional, prosperous and peaceful country for all will be enhanced through strengthened Ethiopia-US relations," Abiy tweeted. The Tigray regional troops clashed with the federal forces in November. Thousands of residents fled the region and humanitarian organisations have been unable to access the region. --BBC--
