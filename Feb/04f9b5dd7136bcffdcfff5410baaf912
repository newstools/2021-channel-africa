The new car market fell 18% in January, he said. Nada is a professional body representing more than 1 300 motor dealerships. The light commercial vehicle market was only 4.9% lower month-on-month, with medium truck sales unchanged and sales of heavy trucks and buses up by 6.6%, indicating there were still vehicles needed by businesses, he said. “Buyers were, however, delaying new passenger car purchases,” he said. Total retail sales in January accounted for 34 784 vehicles, 13.9% down month-on-month. Sales through the dealer channel amounted to 82.6% of this total. Dommisse said the market in January was soft, with a shortage of supply of certain models across the brands. He said they believe the restaurant, beach and alcohol bans had influenced the need for driving for several months now, which meant the purchase decision was being delayed by many ordinary motorists. Continued lockdowns, as well as the second wave of infections, had resulted in consumer uncertainty, which was reflected in generally disappointing sales. --IOL--
