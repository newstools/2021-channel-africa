The victory was McDowell’s first in the NASCAR Cup Series in 357 starts. “I just can’t believe it,” McDowell, 36, said. “So many years just grinding it out hoping for an opportunity like this.”  McDowell led just the one lap. The Front Row Motorsports driver was running third behind Team Penske teammates Joey Logano and Brad Keselowski on the final lap when he bumped Keselowski from behind, who then hit Logano and sent both into spinning, flaming wrecks that took out both cars and a couple of others. “Wanted to make the pass to win the Daytona 500 and it ended up really bad,” Keselowski said. “I don’t feel I made a mistake but I can’t drive everybody else’s car. Frustrating.” Defending series champion, Chase Elliott, finished second while Austin Dillon of Richard Childress Racing came in third. --Reuters--
