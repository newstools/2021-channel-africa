In the 2019 financial year, Nampak Zimbabwe Limited (NZL) entered into an agreement with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and Nampak International Limited (NIL) encompassing the undertaking by the Central Bank to provide foreign currency to pay off the debt held by the local paper and packaging firm to NIL amounting to $66.8 million. In its 2020 annual report, Nampak chairman Kumbirai Katsande said a hedge was put in place in the previous year (2019) following an arrangement made with the RBZ whereby amounts due to the major shareholder’s procurement company were placed with the Apex Bank for future payment in tranches, “which are due to commence from 31 March 2021”. During the year under review, NZL capital expenditure amounted to $97.4 million compared to $51.9 million in 2019, the bulk of which was deferred expenditure from the previous year owing to foreign currency restrictions. “The introduction of the foreign exchange auction trading system from 23 June 2020 has assisted our subsidiaries in obtaining reasonably regular access to foreign exchange for raw material imports. “However, the foreign exchange available remains less than the amounts needed for normal operations,” said Katsande. On performance of the group, he said revenue increased by 1% compared to the prior year as demand remained positive in most market segments. The group’s entities are Hunyani, Mega Pak, CarnaudMetalbox, and Softex Tissue Products. During the year under review Hunyani volumes for the full year declined by 28% compared to the prior year. Meanwhile, the group maintained its engagement with the Government over its estates in terms of the Bilateral Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement with South Africa. --Herald--
