Finance and Environment Ministry officials said the five-year Green Climate Fund would go towards helping 620 000 people in 11 regional counties in arid and semi-arid areas and would aim to restore over 500 000 hectares of rangelands. Keriako Tobiko, the Minister for Environment and Forestry, said these areas account for 80% of the East African country’s land mass, and were more susceptible to the effects of climate change. “These areas and communities living in these areas are most vulnerable; pastoral communities, nomadic communities and really this programme helps to address the most deserving of cases,” Tobiko told an online briefing at the project’s launch. Kenya loses 2.0–2.4% of its gross domestic product (GDP) annually due to effects of climate change, such as drought and floods, according to a 2018 Kenya National Bureau of Statistics study. The study also showed droughts cost Kenya 8% of GDP every five years. --Reuters--
