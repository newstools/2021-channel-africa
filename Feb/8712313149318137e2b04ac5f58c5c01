The increase is the highest since 1991 according to Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA), the country’s agency mandated to control and market the crop. Figures released by the UCDA show that exports for the calendar year January 2020 to December 2020 amounted to 5 492 525 60-kilo bags. Uganda earned $515.94 million from the exports. In 2019, the east African country shipped 4 519 563 bags, fetching $436.54 million. This represents a 22% and 18% increase in quantity and value respectively. In December alone, coffee exported amounted to 422,922 60-kilo bags worth $37.78 million. The improved performance was attributed to an increase in production driven by newly planted coffee trees and favourable weather. Uganda’s coffee is mostly sold in its raw form. The country produces both Robusta and Arabica coffee. Much of the crop is grown by smallholder farmers in the central, eastern, and western regions of the country. On export destinations, Italy maintained its top spot among countries with a high affinity for Ugandan coffee, followed by Germany, Sudan, Belgium, and India. African countries that consume Uganda's coffee the most are Sudan, Morocco, Kenya, Algeria, Egypt, South Africa and South Sudan. Europe is the main destination for Uganda’s coffees with a 63% import share. --AfricaNews--
