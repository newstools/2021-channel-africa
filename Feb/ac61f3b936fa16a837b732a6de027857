The medal matches for women's hockey, 20-over cricket and netball will all take place as part of 11 medal sessions in one day. Ama Agbeze, who captained England to netball gold in 2018, said: "It's a great boost for female sport. It's great that the schedule has been accommodating and to get it sorted this way." Agbeze, who joined the Games board earlier this month, added: "It's highlighting women and it's basically a whole day to celebrate women's sport." There will be a further nine events that will conclude a week earlier on Sunday July 31, with the schedule designed to fit around the final of the women's football European Championship which kicks off at 17:00 BST that day. In total, there will be 283 medal events across 11 days of competition, with the Games in Birmingham set to start on July 28. Meanwhile, Ian Reid, Chief Executive Officer for Birmingham 2022, is confident the Games will be able to go ahead with full capacity venues. He said: "The general environment looks a lot more positive with the publication of the government roadmap (out of the coronavirus lockdown). "Of course it would be remiss of us if we weren't also looking at various scenarios and all the appropriate plans in place to make sure this is a safe environment. But we're really confident that we'll get back, that we'll have full stadiums.‚Äù he added. "We'll start selling tickets later in the summer and we'll feel positive if at that point stadiums are starting to fill up in other events." --BBC--
