"The two parties agreed to start contacts between the relevant bodies with a view to build cooperation in the field of making the Spoutnik V vaccine in Algeria," said a statement from Prime Minister Abdelaziz Djerad after he met with Russian Ambassador to Algiers, Igor Baliaev. The government did not give a manufacturing timeline nor did it specify the quantities of doses to be produced. Algeria received its first 500 000 doses of Sputnik V on Friday last week and started a vaccination campaign on Saturday in the province of Blida. The authorities are expecting a second shipment of Chinaâ€™s Sinopharm vaccine "in the coming days", according to the Communication Minister, Ammar Belhimer. An AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine shipment that had been ordered by the government will be delivered in February, according to the Minister. The Algerian government had announced a budget of $147 million to secure vaccines and to immunise the population of 40 million. Meanwhile, President Abdelamdjid Tebboune is being treated in Germany for a Covid-19 complication. --BBC--
