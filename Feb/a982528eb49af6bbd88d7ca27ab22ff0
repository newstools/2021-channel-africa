The Scot and the Brazilian, champions in 2016, beat Laslo Djere of Serbia and Italy's Stefano Travaglia 6-1 6-2. There was more British success in the women's doubles event with Heather Watson and Leylah Fernandez triumphing in their second-round match. In the mixed doubles Joe Salisbury won with American Desirae Krawczyk. Salisbury, who is defending his men's doubles title with Rajeev Ram, and Krawczyk came through 6-4 3-6 10-7 against fourth seeds Juan Sebastian Cabal of Colombia and Taiwanese Chan Hao-ching. Watson put Wednesday's singles defeat by Anett Kontaveit behind her to make the last 16 in the doubles alongside promising Canadian teenager Fernandez, with a 7-5 6-2 win over Australians Olivia Gadecki and Belinda Woolcock. They will play the Mexican-Canadian partnership of Giuliana Olmos and Sharon Fichman for a place in the quarter-finals. Sixth seeds Murray and Soares, who won two Grand Slam titles together before splitting up in 2019, will take on Italy's Simone Bolelli and Argentine Maximo Gonzalez next. --BBC--
