The government, which is working on a strategy to build bridges with investors under the Zimbabwe is open for Business Mantra, has opened up discussions with white former farmers, companies and foreign governments and is in the process of mobilising over $3 billion compensation fund. “We maintained our engagement with the relevant authorities to regain effective control of our estates in terms of the BIPPA (Bilateral Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement) with South Africa”, said Van Gend. Our intention is to rehabilitate them for timber and agricultural purposes, in support of the current Government policy thrust in this direction. “We remain hopeful for the restoration of title or long term leases which will provide the security required for new investment and job creation,” said the group managing director. Going forward, Nampak says it is pinning hope on internal strategies such as on-going cost controlling measures, while also anticipating that the authorities will make progress on current efforts at improving the local doing business climate. “Given the continual focus on cost control and margin preservation, the group is well positioned to prosper in the coming year. Nampak looks forward to continuing co-operation with the Government and all stakeholders towards achieving further much-needed reforms in Zimbabwe’s macro-economic environment,” said Van Gend. The board has decided against a dividend for the year just ended, on the basis that available cash resources are “expected to fund future capital expenditure projects and meet working capital requirements”. Meanwhile Nampak took a significant hit in volumes during the year to September 30, 2020, as demand for all its key products slowed due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. --Herald--
