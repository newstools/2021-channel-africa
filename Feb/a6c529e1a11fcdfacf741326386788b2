"The government intends to eliminate malaria in Tanzania by 2030," Deputy Minister for Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, Godwin Mollel, told lawmakers in the capital, Dodoma, responding to a question by a member of parliament. Maida Hamad Abdallah, a legislator for special seats, observed that despite government efforts to fight malaria, the disease continues to affect people, especially children. Tanzania's malaria infection rate, at 40% in the 2000s, fell to 7.5% in 2017, thanks to government efforts, Mollel told lawmakers. --Xinhua--
