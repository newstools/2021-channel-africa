Local organisers need to “urgently” pick a new president with just five months left to prepare for the Games amid the Covid-19 pandemic and are setting up a selection committee made up of an equal number of men and women, the group’s Chief Executive Toshiro Muto said last week. The selection committee will hold its first meeting at the start of this week, Nippon Television reported, citing unidentified sources. 

Committee members will submit names of candidates in the days after and could select the new president as soon as this week, the report said. However, the process could carry over into next week if there is a large number of candidates, Nippon Television said. Among those being considered to succeed Mori are Olympic Minister Seiko Hashimoto, a pioneering female lawmaker and seven-time Olympian who is one of only two women in Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s cabinet, media have said. Hashimoto, born just days before the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, said on Friday she had not been asked to replace Mori. Others who have been floated to succeed Mori include Mikako Kotani, a two-time Olympian in synchronised swimming, now known as artistic swimming, who serves on the Japanese Olympic Committee, and Upper House lawmaker Tamayo Marukawa, a previous Olympics Minister. --Reuters--
