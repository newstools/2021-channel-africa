Both vaccines, developed using a technology based on messenger RNA (mRNA), are being distributed at an unprecedented speed as cases mount in the US, with deaths from COVID-19 surpassing the dire milestone of 500 000. Moderna, whose shares rose 4% to $150.7 in trading before the bell, has been aiming to ramp up production of the vaccine, its first and only revenue-generating product. It now aims to produce at least 700 million doses this year and expects to raise production to as much as 1 billion doses by improving its manufacturing process. “2020 demonstrated the power of harnessing mRNA to make medicines,” Chief Executive Officer, Stéphane Bancel, said in a statement. “I believe that 2021 will be an inflection year for Moderna.” Moderna expects cost of sales to be about 20% of product sales in 2021, well above the 4% it recorded a year earlier. The company also said it had completed enrolment for a mid-to-late stage study of the vaccine in adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17, while a study in children aged six months to 11 years will start in the near-term. Moderna’s Chief Medical Officer, Tal Zaks, would leave the company in late September, the company added. --Reuters--
