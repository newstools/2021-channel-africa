Trade between Zimbabwe and UAE has been growing over the past five years, with local businesses exporting $833 million in 2019, up from $148 million in 2015, representing over 460% trade growth. In 2019, The UAE was the second largest export market after South Africa taking up around 20% of total exports from Zimbabwe. There is growing interest from the UAE to create new ties by exploiting mutually beneficial opportunities. Figures from the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI), which were released during the UAE-Zim Food and Agribusiness Virtual Forum last week, also show that the value of bilateral trade with UAE has shot up from $490 million in 2011 to nearly $1 billion by 2019. DCCI Chairperson Majid Salif Al Ghurair told participants during the virtual forum, organised by DCCI, DEAT Capital (Zimbabwe) and DP World that they intend to grow the trade and economic ties further. Zimbabwe’s exports to the UAE are mainly composed of primary products such as minerals hence the need to diversify the product offering to that market. As such, Zimtrade says there is potential for Zimbabwean farmers to increase exports to UAE if they secure direct exports, which will also improve their foreign currency earnings.  --Herald--
