MSCI’s broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside of Japan was last down 0.1% at 733.67 from a record high of 745.89 touched on Thursday. The index is on track for a small weekly loss after two consecutive weeks of gains. Since the start of the year, the index has surged nearly 10.5% largely led by easy monetary and fiscal policies around the world. On Friday, Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index was down 0.8% while Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.4%. Chinese shares started in the red with the blue-chip CSI300 off 0.6%. “The recent move up in longer dated core yields appears to be weighing on equity investors’ mind,” said Rodrigo Catril, forex strategist at National Australia Bank. Core bond yields have pushed higher globally led by the so-called “reflation trade” where investors wager on a pick-up in growth and inflation. 

Successful coronavirus vaccine roll-outs so far and hopes of massive fiscal spending under US President Joe Biden have spurred reflation trades. Germany’s 10-year yield on Thursday posted its highest close since June, British 10-year yields traded at a 10-month top of 0.65% and US Treasury yields are hovering near one-year highs around 1.3%, a large factor supporting the US dollar.
