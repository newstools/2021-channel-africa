The automakers made the announcement as they unveiled brighter outlooks for the financial year ending March 2021 as automobile markets, led by China, rebounded from a coronavirus-induced slump. Honda and Nissan also reported better-than-expected results for the October-December quarter. But Honda cut its sales target by 100 000 vehicles, or 2.2%, on Tuesday to 4.5 million cars, while Nissan lowered its target by 150 000 vehicles, or 3.6%, to 4.015 million units as a chips shortage forced both companies to curb output. “Popular models that sell well were hit hard by semiconductor shortage,” Seiji Kuraishi, Honda’s Chief Operating Officer said during an online press briefing. “We needed to swap around and adjust production plans. But that wasn’t enough,” he added. The global automobile industry has been grappling with a chip shortage since the end of last year, which has in some cases been exacerbated by the former U.S. administration’s sanctions on Chinese chip factories. Asian chipmakers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co are expanding production to make up for shortages, but have warned that it may take some time to crank up output. Some companies such as Japan’s Renesas Electronics are also seeking price hikes for semiconductors that control engines, sensors and other automotive systems. Honda’s Kuraishi predicted that the shortage would ease in the first half of 2021.
