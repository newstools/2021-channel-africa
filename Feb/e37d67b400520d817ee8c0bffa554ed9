The militants were heavily armed and raided the camp in Boni in at least one armoured vehicle, the sources said. The attack caused several injuries and considerable damage to the camp, the sources said. It is unclear where the suspected militants would have got an armoured vehicle. The Malian army said on social media that it had received air support from France's anti-jihadist force in the region, and the suspected militants had suffered heavy losses. --BBC--
