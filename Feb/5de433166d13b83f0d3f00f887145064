They briefed the media on 5G technology standards and opportunities for industrialisation, as well as growing concerns raised by social media regarding 5G and human health. 5G is the fifth generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks, which cellphone companies began deploying worldwide in 2019. It provide connectivity to most current cellphones. CSIR Senior Researcher Dr Essa Suleman says, “With regards to 5G and Covid-19 there are several conspiracy theories with regards to 5G weakening immune system of the person thus resulting in Covid-19 infections.   

5G causes the virus itself. 5G rollout led to the spread of the virus globally. 5G causes the virus to mutate and that 5G will be used in vaccines to spy on citizens. All of the conspiracy theories related to COVID -19 and 5G are false and there is no evidence to support these claims.” The Council says their research shows that all the theories about 5G and Covid-19 are false and should be rejected in the strongest term until there’s solid evidence to support the conspiracy theories. This after several reports alleged that 5G technologies cause several health effects, including the spread and mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
