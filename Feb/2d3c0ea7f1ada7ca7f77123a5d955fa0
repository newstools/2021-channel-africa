"The scams we allege in this investigation include romance scams targeting the elderly, business e-mail compromise scams, and even fraudulent Covid-19 relief loans," the FBI's William F. Sweeney said in a statement. Four of the accused had between them controlled more than 45 bank accounts in which more than $50 million had been deposited between 2003 and 2020, the statement alleged. A vast majority of the deposits consisted of large wire transfers and cheque or cash deposits from various US-based individuals and entities, the statement added. As part of the investigation, four luxury vehicles suspected to have been purchased with the proceeds of fraud had been seized, the statements said. --BBC--
