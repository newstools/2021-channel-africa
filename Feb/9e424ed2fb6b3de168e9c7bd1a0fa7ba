Red Bull has concluded a deal to buy Honda's F1 engine technology and will run the engines until 2024. The drinks giant has set up a new company to maintain the engines at its technology base in Milton Keynes. The move has been made possible by a decision by F1 bosses to freeze engine development from 2022-24. The move is aimed at giving Red Bull flexibility and independence before the introduction of a new engine formula into F1 in 2025. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said the company was taking "a long-term view" andthat its new engine arm had to be ready to design the power-unit for the 2025 rules as well as maintain the ex-Honda one in the intervening years. He added: "Strategically, this is a big commitment by the group. It shows their commitment to F1. To bring it on site is an enormous undertaking and one that truly integrates the power-unit into the chassis. We have taken control of our own destiny in that respect." Honda will continue to develop the engine through 2021 and ensure it is ready for the introduction of a new rule that requires 10% of the petrol used to be composed of bio-fuel in 2022.
