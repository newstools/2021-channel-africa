The activities of jihadists have grown in the region despite military operations to contain them. France has more than 5,000 military personnel in the region as part of a long-running operation intended to stop the insurgency. Prime Minister Christophe Dabiré told parliament that the government will not exclude talks with Islamists militants to secure peace in the country. He said that to end the security crisis it was important to address those responsible for the terrorist attacks. Burkina Faso's neighbours Mali and Niger have previously indicated willingness to negotiate with the insurgents. Former Malian president Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, while in power, said that his government was preparing to negotiate with a local a- Qaeda affiliate. He was overthrown in a coup last year before any progress was made. The French government is opposed to talks with the jihadists. --BBC--
