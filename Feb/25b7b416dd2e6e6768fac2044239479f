The dolphins were found dead on the coast of the island of Bazaruto in the province of Inhambane. The first 25 dolphins were discovered on Sunday and another 86 on Tuesday. All the dolphins are of the same species, Stenella Longirostris. The Bazaruto Archipelago National Park Head of inspection, Tomás Manasse, said initial autopsy did not indicate any “problem with the skin, tongue or intestines” but samples had been sent to a laboratory in the capital, Maputo. Experts say last week’s cyclone Guambe, that caused unrest in the waters of the island of Bazaruto, may be one of the causes of the dolphins death. --BBC--
