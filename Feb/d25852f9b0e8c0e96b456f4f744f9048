Japan’s second-biggest automaker by sales will announce the decision after a board meeting as early as Friday, the people said, requesting anonymity because the information is not public. Mibe will be confirmed as president and representative director at an annual shareholders’ meeting in June, they said. Mibe, who is a director at Honda, will replace Takahiro Hachigo, who has held the CEO role for six years. Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Seiji Kuraishi will remain in his post to support Mibe, the people said. Honda said in a statement on Wednesday that it is not true the company has decided to change its CEO. It was not immediately clear whether Hachigo would retain a position at Honda with Mibe as CEO. --Reuters--
