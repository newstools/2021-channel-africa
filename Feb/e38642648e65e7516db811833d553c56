The number of confirmed cases now stands at 6Â 017, up from 4 784 at the start of February. A United Nations (UN) representative for Somalia, Adam Abdelmoula, said the surge had caught many people by surprise. "Whenever we compared the numbers with Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda, we declared victory prematurely and now we are seeing this upsurge," he told the BBC. Abdelmoula confirmed recent reports that Somalia was facing oxygen shortages in hospitals. The government had promised that vaccines donated through the global Covax initiative would arrive before the end of the month, but Abdelmoula said this was unlikely as the paperwork had only been completed this week. At the earliest, they would in the first two weeks of March, he added. As well as Covid-19, Somalia continues to battle a desert locust infestation and the effects of floods and droughts. The UN estimates that 5.9 million people will need humanitarian assistance compared with 5.2 million in 2020. --BBC--
