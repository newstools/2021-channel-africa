European stocks were higher, with the STOXX 600 gaining 0.4% and London’s FTSE 100 up 0.1%. That followed a subdued Asian session as markets in China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan were closed for holidays. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.2%, having already climbed for four sessions to gain more than 10% so far this year. Investors were also reflecting on the first phone call between US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, where Biden said a free and open Indo-Pacific was a priority and Xi warning confrontation would be a “disaster” for both nations. With Chinese markets closed, there was little reaction to news the Biden administration will look at adding “new targeted restrictions” on certain sensitive technology exports to China and would maintain tariffs for now. Futures for the S&P 500 were 0.3% higher, having hit historic highs on Wednesday.
