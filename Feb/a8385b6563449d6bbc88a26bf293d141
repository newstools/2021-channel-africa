In the final clash on Margaret Court Arena on the opening day of the Grand Slam, the 21-year-old Shapovalov and Sinner, 19, put on a masterclass of clean hitting and athleticism in a first career meeting between them. “Today was just incredible tennis from both of us,” Shapovalov told reporters. “Honestly, I think Jannik is super talented. He’s such an amazing player, he’s a great guy, great worker. I’m sure he’s going to be a very, very tough opponent in the future... I’m a really big fan of his game and how he is.” In an evenly-contested match with hardly anything to choose between the two youngsters, Sinner, who on Sunday became the youngest to win two ATP titles since Novak Djokovic in 2006, made a fast start to jump to a 3-0 lead before taking the set. Against Sinner’s immaculate hitting and robust court coverage, Shapovalov needed to raise his game and the world number 12 managed to find an extra gear and some more power behind his shots to take the next two sets. Having played both singles and doubles almost everyday in the tuneup event the past week, Sinner’s legs seemed to have run out of juice when he fell back 3-1 in the fourth set. But the 32nd-ranked Italian found the energy to stage a fightback and level the contest at 2-2. Before the deciding set, Shapovalov had a lengthy argument with the chair umpire after being denied a toilet break. He then received some medical attention for a shoulder niggle and returned to the court to break Sinner in the opening game.
