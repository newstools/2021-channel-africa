Investors bet that Covid-19 vaccinations and United States (US) stimulus will deliver a durable economic recovery after a year of lockdowns. Bitcoin added to the bullish mood, briefly climbing above $50,000 for the first time, while prospects of “reflation” a boost in inflation from extraordinary fiscal stimulus pushed US Treasury yields higher. US President Joe Biden was traveling to Wisconsin on Tuesday to press his case for a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill in the political battleground state that helped secure his victory in last year’s presidential election. The MSCI’s global stock index was about flat at 684.70 after hitting a record high of 687.26 earlier in the session. On Wall Street, the Dow hit an all-time high on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq retreated slightly from record levels, as investors bet on more fiscal aid to lift the world’s biggest economy from a coronavirus-driven slump. “The reflation trade continues to push equity markets across all industries and multi-caps … and this rally could continue in the near-term,” said Tony Bedikian, head of global markets at Citizens Bank in Boston. The Nasdaq dipped as technology stocks moved lower, while concerns over rising interest rates kept the benchmark S&P 500 little changed. European shares ended about flat around a one-year peak on Tuesday as a boost from major mining and bank stocks was tempered by losses in most other sectors, with investors remaining uncertain over a euro zone economic recovery. --Reuters--
