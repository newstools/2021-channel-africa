She added in statements that the Ministry will start vaccinating the elderly along with people with chronic diseases against COVID, in mid-February. Egypt received the first batch of 50 000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine on Sunday. The Egyptian Authority for Unified Procurement, Medical Supply and Technology Management (AUPP) contracted with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company to get 20 million doses of the Coronavirus vaccine. Major General Doctor Bahaa El-Din Zidan, Chairman of the AUPP Board of Directors said that vaccines are safe and effective, saying “we support all the state's efforts to confront the Coronavirus, especially in providing vaccines and drugs.” Spokesperson of the Health Ministry, Khaled Megahed, said that the Egyptian Drug Authority is taking the necessary measures for authorizing the Russian Coronavirus vaccine. He continued that the distribution of the coronavirus vaccine is optional, adding that those who want to receive the vaccine should register through an online website. Egypt has recently started vaccinating the medical teams in isolation hospitals, then the senior citizens and people with chronic disease would receive their shots later, he said. A total of 1315 medical personnel in isolation hospitals have been vaccinated against the virus for far, while more than 3 000 people registered online to receive the vaccine.  --EgyptToday--
