The call was made this week, with the board saying registration would be open from February 1  to  March 30.

After that, the board would conduct a selective field verification, which would take place before the beginning of the marketing season on May 1.

The NAB is a state-owned enterprise tasked to promote the country agronomy and horticulture industry.

It is also set up to facilitate the production, processing, storage and marketing of controlled agronomic and horticulture operations.

Registration forms are available on the NAB website, or can be requested from the board via email.

“Provision has been made for farmers with limited or no access to an internet connection, whereby they can register at their nearest Agricultural Developmental Centre, where they will be assisted by officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Land Reform,” the NAB notice reads.

The board advised farmers to obtain the correct documents outlined in the public notice.

It warned that unregistered grain farmers would not be allowed to sell their grain to registered millers or silos until they are registered with the NAB.
