According to the airline’s application to the US Department of Transportation for an amendment to its current US Foreign Air Carrier Permit, RwandAir plans to launch scheduled services to New York from Kigali, through Accra in Ghana. The airline says it has already secured authorisation from Ghana to use Accra as the last point-of-departure to the US. “RwandAir has already secured authorisation from the government of the Republic of Ghana to use Kotoka International Airport as the Last Point of Departure (LPD) into the United States,” it said in the filing done on January 21, 2021. At Accra, RwandAir will exercise fifth freedom traffic rights as provided for in the bilateral air service agreements of both US and Ghana with Rwanda, it said. In the amendment to its filing, RwandAir is seeking to be allowed to either enter code sharing agreement or wet lease with “properly supervised US or foreign air carrier when Rwanda successfully achieves an IASA Category 1 rating.” --TheEastAfrican--
