Defending champion and world number one Djokovic overcame Frances Tiafoe 6-3 6-7 (3-7) 7-6 (7-2) 6-3. Australian Kyrgios then produced a thrilling five-set win over Ugo Humbert in front of a rowdy John Cain Arena. Kyrgios showed his usual mix of fiery antics and exciting shots to beat the Frenchman 5-7 6-4 3-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-4. He fell to his knees after winning the match before sitting in his chair and shaking his head in disbelief. Kyrgios has often said that the John Cain Arena, which is open to general ticket-holders, is his favourite to play on because of the atmosphere. With numbers at Melbourne Park restricted to up to 30 000 per day because of coronavirus, and falling well short of that so far this week, this was the first time anything resembling a 'normal' tennis crowd noise had been heard for months. Home fans did not let up as they cheered a Kyrgios fightback from 5-4 down in the fourth set, before seeing him through a tie-break and, somehow, a winning fifth set. "Honestly, if you were in my head, I was thinking about everything I was going to cop if I lost that match," a disbelieving Kyrgios said. "I don't know what to say. I am lost for words." He will face 2020's finalist and US Open champion Dominic Thiem next, after the Austrian eased past Germany's Dominik Koepfer 6-4 6-0 6-2. In hot conditions at Melbourne Park, Djokovic served 26 aces to Tiafoe's 23 as the 33-year-old came through in three hours and 30 minutes. "It was a very tough match and difficult conditions, while we had sun on the court it was very warm a lot of long rallies," Djokovic said. "I want to give a hand to Frances for a great fightback, it was a fantastic match. It is not the first time I am in this kind of situation but I was fortunate to get through the third set, it was anyone's - high quality tennis, he gave it his all." In other matches, Austrian third seed Thiem was only on court for one hour and 39 minutes as he beat Germany's Koepfer 6-4 6-0 6-2 on Rod Laver Arena. But Swiss Stan Wawrinka exited in a fifth-set tie-break loss to Marton Fucsovics. Hungarian Fucsovics, the world number 55, raced into a two-set lead before 2014 winner and 17th seed Wawrinka fought back on John Cain Arena. Wawrinka then had three match points but it was Fucsovics who got the better of a 15-minute deciding tie-breaker to progress 7-5 6-1 4-6 2-6 7-6 (11-9). He will face 14th seed Milos Raonic in the next round after the Canadian beat France's Corentin Moutet 6-7 (1-7) 6-1 6-1 6-4. Argentine eighth seed Diego Schwartzman is also through after seeing off French lucky loser Alexandre Muller 6-2 6-0 6-3. Alexander Zverev, who lost the US Open final to Thiem, made light work of American Maxime Cressy, winning 7-5 6-4 6-3. --BBC--
