Sudan warned of the repercussions of Ethiopia's acts, particularly their impact on security and stability eastern Africa. In that context, Sudan called on Ethiopia to resume the dialogue and set up marks indicating the borders of each state in accordance to existing international agreements between both states. Member of the Sovereign Council of Sudan Shams El Din Al Kebashy had affirmed that his country does not aim for demarcation but for Ethiopia to abide by existing borders. He stated that Sudan had restored a big portion of its lands occupied by Ethiopia, and that his state can accept mediation, if Ethiopia installs the marks. On the other hand, Ethiopia set the withdrawal of Sudanese forces from the disputed area as a condition to revive the dialogue. Al Fashaqa is a Sudanese border area spanning over 250 square kilometres and that used to be cultivated by Ethiopian farmers under overthrown President Omar al-Bashir. Now, the transitional government is determined to recover all Sudanese territories, and inhibit Ethiopia from carrying out the second filling of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam without reaching a legal binding agreement.  --EgyptToday--
