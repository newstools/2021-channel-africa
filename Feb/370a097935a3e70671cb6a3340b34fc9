They have asked for a four-fold increase on their previous request for 10 million doses from the African Union. "We have applied for 41 million doses of a combination of Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines," Faisal Shuaib, who heads the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, told the Reuters news agency. An additional 16 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine are expected in February from the World Health Organisation-backed Covax programme. As Nigeria fights a second wave of COVID-19, officials are looking to multiple sources to secure more vaccines to inoculate its enormous population. During a press conference in the capital, Abuja on Monday, the Health Minister also said the countryâ€™s drug agency was looking into vaccines from Russia and India. So far Nigeria, with a population of around 186 million, has officially recorded over 130 000 cases of COVID-19, including 1 600 deaths. --BBC--
