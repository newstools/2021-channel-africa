Acting Prime Minister Themba Masuku said the restrictions will remain in place as the government plans to rollout vaccination. He said a decline in virus cases had been recorded during the time the country was on partial lockdown. The last lockdown had totally banned the sale of alcohol for four weeks. Eswatini was formerly known as Swaziland and neighbours South Africa where a coronavirus variant has caused a rise in cases. The country has recorded 16,709 confirmed cases of the virus including 640 deaths. --BBC--
