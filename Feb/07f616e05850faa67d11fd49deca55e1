Namungo were beaten 3-1 by the Angolans but went through 7-5 on aggregate having won the first leg of their play-off 6-2. Both legs of the tie were played in Tanzania after Covid 19-related issues meant Primeiro were unable to host their home leg in Luanda. Namungo will now feature in the group phase of Africa's second tier club competition for the first time. The Tanzanians will be in Group D alongside Morocco's Raja Casablanca, Pyramids of Egypt and Zambian outfit Nkana. The group-stage matches are due to begin next month, with the top two in each group progressing to the quarter-finals. --BBC--
