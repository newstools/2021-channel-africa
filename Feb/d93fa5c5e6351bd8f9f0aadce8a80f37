With a number of countries employing lockdowns to cushion themselves against the global Covid-19 pandemic, Tanzania also found itself on the losing end. The Tanzania Tourist Board (TTB) said yesterday that the number of tourists who visited the country last year plummeted to 800 000. This represents a 47% drop from the 1.5 million tourists that visited the country in 2019. “A number of countries closed their skies and were on lockdown and this had a negative effect on the number of tourists seeking to visit the country,” TTB’s managing director Devota Mdachi said. She was speaking during the announcement of the Swahili International Tourism Expo (SITE) that is expected to take place in October. The SITE, she said, was one of the initiatives that TTB was putting in place to tweak the tourist numbers. TTB initiated the SITE so as to give an opportunity to Tanzania tourist agents, especially those with small capital, to meet with international tourist agents so they can start raise their business profiles. --TheCitizen--
