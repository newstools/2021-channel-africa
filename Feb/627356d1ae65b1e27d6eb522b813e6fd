The Independent Examinations Board says some matric learners were so overwhelmed by the disruptions and the shift to online learning that they decided to take the year off; while others pushed through achieving multiple distinctions along the way. The IEB matric pass rate is 98.07% this year slightly lower than last year’s pass rate of 98.82%. Meanwhile, two Johannesburg learners share their experience after achieving multiple distinctions. “I am Sinazo Mthethwa from Saheti in Johannesburg; I am filled with so much excitement and so much joy that I passed matric with distinctions and I am so eager for the future. 2020 was a tough year to matriculate in. I would not have been able to do that without the support of teachers, parents and family.” Sinazo obtained 8 distinctions including in Accounting, English, isiZulu, Mathematics, Physical Sciences and Advanced Programme Mathematics winning the Commendable Achiever Award. She says she worked hard from the beginning of the year and is now due to study for Actuarial Science at the University of Cape Town. Another high achiever is Kiara Kekana from Elkana House High School. She obtained 7 distinctions including in Maths and Science. “I feel relieved. 2020 was a challenging year not just for me but for everyone; for being able to achieve results that I can look back and be proud of makes me over the moon. It was more about making myself proud and about what I was capable of achieving so looking at my results now I feel absolutely amazing.”
