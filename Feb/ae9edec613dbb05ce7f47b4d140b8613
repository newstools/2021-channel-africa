State Governor, Babagana Zulum, said the attackers fired rocket propelled grenades into densely populated areas in the city, including a children's playground. He said the grenades were launched from the outskirts of the city. Pictures released by local authorities show dozens of injured people in hospital, including children. Zulum on Wednesday visited two hospitals where the injured were being treated. He said the use of long distance bombs by insurgents was part of a new trend that needed to be stopped. A similar attack on the city took place in July when three rockets left four dead and three wounded. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, but Maiduguri is the birth place of Boko Haram, and the city has frequently been targeted by the insurgents. The Boko Haram insurgency, which has lasted for more than a decade, has killed at least 36 000 people and displaced two million in north-eastern Nigeria. --BBC--
