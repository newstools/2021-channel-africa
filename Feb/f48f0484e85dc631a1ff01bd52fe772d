The Greek, 22, eventually triumphed 6-7 (5-7) 6-4 6-1 6-7 (5-7) 6-4 in four hours, 32 minutes on Rod Laver Arena. "I just want to go for a nice bath," said Tsitsipas who next plays Sweden's Mikael Ymer at Melbourne Park. "Forget the tennis. Let's thank the fans, everyone who filled the stadium. It's great having that energy back." Kokkinakis, the world number 267, has been plagued by injuries in recent years but the 24-year-old showed why he remains highly rated on tour by pushing Tsitsipas all the way. "Kokkinakis is a great competitor and great fighter," added Tsitsipas. "It was difficult fighting him today. "He is a talent, he has huge potential, he just needs to take advantage of it and make the most out of his career. He wasn't able to play all these years, the injuries he had, but I am happy to see him back competing at a high level." Seventh seed Andrey Rublev progressed with a straightforward victory over Brazilian Thiago Monteiro, with the 23-year-old Russian winning 6-4 6-4 7-6 (10-8). He will face 39-year-old Feliciano Lopez next after the Spaniard came from two sets down to beat Italy's 31st seed Lorenzo Sonego 5-7 3-6 6-3 7-5 6-4. Lopez is playing in a record 75th Grand Slam in a row, a run that started at the 2002 French Open. Russian 19th seed Karen Khachanov also reached round three on Thursday, beating Lithuania's Ricardas Berankis 6-2 6-4 6-4. Matteo Berrettini, the Italian ninth seed, beat Czech Tomas Machac 6-3 6-2 4-6 6-3, but Croatian 22nd seed Borna Coric suffered a 6-4 6-2 4-6 6-4 defeat by American Mackenzie McDonald. --BBC--
