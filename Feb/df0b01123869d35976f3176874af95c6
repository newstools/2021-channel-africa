Both companies are subsidiaries of the Egyptian Company for Metal Constructions (Metalco), which is one of the Public Business Sector ministry’s companies. The first protocol between the EAMCO and Bright Skies is to develop an electric bus model, stipulating that EAMCO should produce all components of the bus, provided that Bright Skies contribute to the development of the battery and electric propulsion system. The second protocol, which was signed between El Nasr Automotive Manufacturing Company and Bright Skies Company, includes the work of a feasibility study in cooperation between the two sides, with the aim of establishing a research and development center for batteries, control systems and electric propulsion for electric-powered cars, based on the global expertise of Bright Skies in this field. It is also expected that the protocol will pave the way for the establishment of the first Egyptian research and development center for the electric car industry, after the completion of the feasibility study, which will take 6 months to complete, provided that the place designated for the establishment of the center will be agreed upon based on what the study will recommend, taking into account the utilization of the capabilities of the Nasr Manufacturing Company. The signing of these two agreements is an ambitious step to deepen and localize the Egyptian technological component in the future automotive industry. Minister of Public Business Sector, confirmed that the cooperation with Bright Skies Company reflects the state’s keenness to maximize partnerships with the private sector, especially with regard to modern technology in light of the global trend and development in the electric car industry, with the aim of keeping pace with progress in this industry and increasing the percentage of the local component and localizing technology in Egypt. For his part, Wafa Tofils, the Executive Managing Director of the Engineering Company for the Automobile Industry, noted that this protocol is a first step towards the production of Egyptian clean energy vehicles, as the first stage is the production of buses running on natural gas, and the next stage is buses powered by electricity. Executive Managing Director of El-Nasr Automotive Manufacturing Company, Hany El-Khouly, explained that this step confirms the return of El-Nasr Automotive Industry, not only to produce an electric car, but also to produce an Egyptian car that is able to compete locally and internationally in the hands and minds of the people of the country. For his part, CEO of Brightskies, Khaled Al-Amrawi, indicated that it represents a serious first step to deepen the localization of the electric car industry in Egypt in order to support research and development efforts to produce and develop purely Egyptian parts and systems in the field of auto electronics. The automobile industry is witnessing a technological revolution, represented by self-driving cars, electric cars and cars connected to the Internet, and this is reflected in the increase in the technological component represented in the electronics and software circles, which is a strong competitive advantage for Egyptian cadres. El Nasr Automotive Manufacturing Company had signed an agreement with the Chinese company Dong Feng to rehabilitate the plant and produce the first Egyptian electric car, as production of the E-70 electric vehicle is scheduled to start during the first quarter of 2022. --EgyptToday--
