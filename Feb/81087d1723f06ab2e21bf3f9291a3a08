It was the fourth eagle for the week and second of the day for Berger, who came to the 72 hole tied with Maverick McNealy. But the eagle at the famous par-5 finishing hole at Pebble Beach Golf Links moved Berger ahead by two to finish with a 7-under 65 and 18-under 270 total. “It’s probably right up there at the top,” Berger told CBS Sports about his putt following his win. “That was probably the best putt I have ever hit in my life. I’ve worked so hard in the last six or seven months to get to where I’m at, so it’s nice to see the results come.” Berger had a near flawless round that included an eagle and two birdies on the front, the eagle at 18 and two birdies on the back, with a bogey at number eight as the only blemish on the scorecard. The 27-year-old Florida native, currently number 15 in the Official World Golf Ranking, had posted two top-10 in two prior starts at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am (T-10 in 2015, T-5 in 2020), and last season, he earned his third career victory at the 2020 Charles Schwab Challenge, the PGA Tour’s first tournament back following a three-month hiatus due to Covid-19. McNealy finished with a 66 to take second place at 16 under, one stroke ahead of Patrick Cantlay (68) and third-round leader Jordan Spieth (70), who was coming off his best result in nearly a year, a tie for fourth place in the Waste Management Phoenix Open last week. Spieth, who won the 2017 Pebble Beach event for one of his 11 career PGA Tour victories, hasn’t been victorious since claiming the 2017 Open Championship. --Reuters--
