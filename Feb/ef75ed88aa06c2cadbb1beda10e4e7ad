India closed on 39-1, requiring a record 420 to win or, more realistically, needing to bat out the final day for a draw. India, who faced 13 overs, lost opener Rohit Sharma to Jack Leach. Shubman Gill and Cheteshwar Pujara reached the close unbeaten on 15 and 12 respectively. England were tentative in their attempt to set India a challenging target - posting 178 all out from 46.3 overs. They initially batted positively - building on a 241-run first-innings lead secured earlier in the day - but their scoring rate dropped to a crawl after tea. Rather than declare, they batted on, allowing overs to be lost from the game - overs which they may need when they attempt to take nine wickets on day five. India began day four on 257-6 in their first innings and added 80 runs before they were dismissed for 337 shortly before lunch. Washington Sundar made an impressive 85 while James Anderson and Leach took two wickets each. Should England secure victory and take a 1-0 lead in the four-Test series, it would mean just a second defeat for India on home soil since 2013.
