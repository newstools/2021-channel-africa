Captain Joe Root said Moeen had "chosen" to leave, although his exit had been planned for some time. "We are sorry the impression we gave was that Moeen is being treated differently to other people. He isn't," said Silverwood. "The decision for him to go home was ours and we will own that decision." It had been planned for Moeen, 33, to miss the final two Tests in Ahmedabad, but England approached him over staying in India on the fourth day of the second Test in Chennai. After it was decided that Moeen would leave, Root told the media following England's 317-run defeat: "It's come to a point where he wants to get out of the bubble." Realising he had not expressed himself clearly enough, Root reiterated his support for Moeen going home in a conversation with him at the team hotel. Under England's rotation policy, Ben Stokes, Jofra Archer, Jos Buttler, Jonny Bairstow, Sam Curran and Mark Wood have been rested from some Tests this winter. "The decision for Moeen to go home was ours, as it was with the other players," said Silverwood. Moeen spent 14 days in isolation after testing positive for coronavirus in Sri Lanka in January. When he recovered, he revealed he was due to be rested for the last two Tests of the India series.
