Chad has in the past said it would deploy in the "three border zone" but did not. The Sahel region heads of state are meeting in Chad's capital, N'Djamena, and French President Emmanuel Macron will join the meeting via video link. DÃ©by has called for more international support to the Sahel countries in their fight against extremists. He said poverty in the region had made it easier for young people to be recruited by extremists and said development funds would help alleviate it. France has 5 100 troops in the Sahel region which has been a front line in the war against militant groups for almost a decade. --BBC--
