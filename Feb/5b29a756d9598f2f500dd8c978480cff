The distribution of the shares, which will be locked for four years, will take place throughout 2021. The cost of the programme was not yet clear but BP said it would not impact its $2.5 billion cost savings target or plans to reduce debt to $35 billion this year. Looney, who took office a year ago, held a company-wide town hall meeting last Tuesday where he announced that all employees would receive shares, the first such programme in BP’s history, according to a company spokesman. “Whether you are a barista in New Zealand, a drilling engineer in Azerbaijan, a pump clerk in South Africa or an analyst in India – over 60 000 people in 66 different countries will receive a share in BP’s future,” Looney said in an internal message seen by Reuters that followed the town hall meeting. The London-based company’s shares have risen nearly 10% so far this year, lifted by stronger crude oil prices. --Reuters--
