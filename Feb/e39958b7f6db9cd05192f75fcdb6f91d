Colonel, Ismael Wague, was reported to have been kidnapped on the Badiangara axis in the central Mopti region. A statement from the Ministry is quoted as saying the reports were spread by people opposed to the peace process. Colonel Wague was last year presented as the spokesman of a group of soldiers who overthrew President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke√Øta. The military junta was dissolved in January 2021 but senior military personnel still hold several key posts in a 25-member transitional government. --BBC--
