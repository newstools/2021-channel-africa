In a rematch of their tumultuous 2018 United States (US) Open decider, Osaka underlined her status as the new queen of women’s tennis and soaked up the cheers from the Rod Laver Arena crowd as fans returned to the Grand Slam after a five-day lockdown. Williams, however, was left in tears. The 39-year-old cut short her post-match news conference after breaking down when asked whether she had just had a bad day at the office. “I had so many opportunities, I made too many mistakes there and easy mistakes,” said the American. “Not like I was on the run or anything. 

“I don’t know. I’m done,” she added before exiting the room in tears. Osaka, the 2019 champion, will meet the winner of Jennifer Brady and Karolina Muchova for the title as the 23-year-old bids to claim her fourth Grand Slam crown. “It’s just always an honour to play her and I just didn’t want to go out really dud. I just wanted to try my best,” Osaka said after her 75-minute masterclass on a steamy afternoon. “I was a little kid watching her play and just to be on the court playing against her is a dream. “You’re competitive, you are playing against another competitor, that itself is the funnest part because tennis is a game.”
