For the past two weeks, workers in Lubombo Referral Hospital and Good Sheperd Mission Hospital have been fearing for their health after supply ran out. Some body bags were procured on Monday following complaints from staff. "They were procured after the complaints from the orderlies and nurses as some of the staff members felt that they were at risk of being exposed to the virus because they had to make sure that the bodies were wrapped in a satisfactory manner that would not expose any body parts. We just hope the bags will be enough to last us for a while," a source, who sought anonymity was quoted as saying. Minister of Health, Lizzie Nkosi, says she is unaware of the shortage. The country has so far confirmed 15 804 cases of the virus including 574 deaths. --BBC--
