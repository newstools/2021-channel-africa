Violence had broken out between Ilobu and Erin-Osun communities over land on Saturday, local media reported. Security officers in the state have been ordered to arrest and prosecute those found violating the 24-hour curfew, which began on Sunday. "As a responsible and responsive (government) that took the sacred oath to protect the lives and property of our citizens, we believe that the declaration of curfew is the way to go in this circumstance," the statement shared online read in part. --BBC--
