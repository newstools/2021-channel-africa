Luis Suarez gave Atletico the lead in the 28th minute with a curling free kick which was cancelled out by Cadiz forward Alvaro Negredo seven minutes later before Saul Niguez restored the visitors' advantage moments before the break. Cadiz had a strong penalty claim turned down on the stroke of halftime when Atletico's Koke blocked the ball with his hand while on the ground but Atleti got a spot kick just after the break which Suarez converted for his 14th goal of the season. Negredo reduced the deficit to one goal with a scrappy strike in the 71st and Atletico were pegged back in their area for a long spell before Koke struck in the 88th to clinch an eighth consecutive league victory for Diego Simeone's side. --Reuters--
