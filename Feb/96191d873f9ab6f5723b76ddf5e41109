Halep, who lost in straight sets to Serena Williams in the Australian Open quarter-finals last week, did not specify why she was pulling out of the March 1-6 hard court tournament. “Unfortunately I have made the decision to withdraw from the Qatar Total Open,” Halep said in a statement released by the tournament organisers. “It’s always one of my favourite stops on the tour and I really look forward to being back in Doha next year.” World number one Ash Barty and American Sofia Kenin are expected to compete in the tournament along with the likes of Elina Svitolina, Karolina Pliskova and Aryna Sabalenka. --Reuters--
