The Swedish striker, 39, reached the milestone with a shot into the top corner in the first half. He then tapped in his 501st goal and his 14th in 11 league games this season. Ante Rebic scored twice in as many minutes to complete the comfortable win against Serie A's bottom side. AC moved two points clear of city rivals Inter Milan at the top with 49 points from 21 games. --BBC--
