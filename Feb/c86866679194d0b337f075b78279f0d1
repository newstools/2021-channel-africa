Crystal Palace scouts will follow Mostafa in Galatasaray’s clash against Alanyaspor in the Turkish League on Saturday.

According to the Turkish reports, Crystal Palace see Mostafa Mohamed as a perfect solution to the team’s attacking problems.

Mostafa joined Galatsaray on one-and-half season loan from Zamalek and he managed to score in his debut in the league before scoring the winning goal in Istanbul Derby against Fenerbahçe.

Mostafa also scored a goal in his team’s 3-2 loss in the Turkish Cup before scoring a last-minute winner in his team’s last match against Kasimpasa.
