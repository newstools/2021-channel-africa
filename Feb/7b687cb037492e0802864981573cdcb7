Bushiri and his wife, Mary, are facing charges of money laundering and fraud in South Africa. They skipped bail in November last year and fled home to Malawi. Family lawyers quoted by eNCA say Bushiri's daughters and mother-in-law were stopped from leaving Malawi for Kenya. The daughters were leaving to seek medical attention. A Malawian court is scheduled to rule next month on the extradition of Bushiri and his wife to face trial in South Africa. --BBC--
