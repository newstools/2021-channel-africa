Nadal’s bid for a record 21st Grand Slam crown gathered pace with a 6-3 6-4 6-2 demolition of Fabio Fognini that pushed the Spaniard into his 13th quarter-final at Melbourne Park. The lower back strain that forced Nadal to miss the ATP Cup is now disappearing in the rear-view mirror and he heads into his next clash against fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas without having dropped a set. “The first set without a doubt has been my best level in the tournament,” Nadal told reporters after routing 16 seed Fognini on a sun-bathed afternoon at Rod Laver Arena. “It’s normal, too, because I was able to practise for two days in a row. I am excited about playing that quarter-finals match." “If we compare how I was five days ago and how I am today’s situation, it’s different, and my perspective and excitement is completely different, too.” While Nadal booked his 43rd Grand Slam quarter-final with two hours and 16 minutes of work against Fognini, Tsitsipas did not lift a racket against ninth seed Matteo Berrettini, who pulled out with an abdominal strain. Norwegian Casper Ruud’s hopes of a maiden Grand Slam quarter-final were also undone by an abdominal injury as he retired two sets in against Russian Andrey Rublev.
