This is a move that could push the country’s fiscus over the precipice as the main budget deficit is now expected to be at 15.7% of the gross domestic product (GDP). At least three public sector unions on Monday approached the Constitutional Court for leave to appeal an earlier Labour Court judgment after the government reneged on implementing wage increases. The Labour Court last year declared the 2018 wage agreement as invalid and unconstitutional, favouring the government in its decision to not honour the wage agreement. In response to the Western Cape provincial treasury, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said the national government would cover the increase in the cost of compensation of employees in provinces. “I wish to state that if the court orders the collective the agreement be implemented, or a settlement agreement that requires that additional funding is reached, the National Treasury will make recommendations to Cabinet for the introduction of the required draft legislation in Parliament to provide for such funding,” Mboweni said. This goes against what Mboweni said during his Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) in October where he announced drastic expenditure reductions within the non-interest expenditure category. He said that while expenditure reductions would be wide and deep, the bulk of the adjustment would be absorbed in compensation costs. Mboweni said no additional funding was available over the medium term, adding that departments needed to fund shortfalls by adjusting their compensation baselines. Over the past five years, public sector employee compensation grew by 7.2 percent a year on average – well above inflation. Currently, some 35% of all government spending goes toward civil service salaries. --IOL--
