Brady was a picture of anguish early in the clash on a stifling day at Rod Laver Arena but gradually dialled in her power game before crushing Pegula in the final set. The 22 seed has a golden chance to reach her first Grand Slam final after world number one Ash Barty was shocked by Karolina Muchova in the early quarter-final on Wednesday. With Serena Williams to face Naomi Osaka in the other semi-final, the Australian Open could have another all-American title match on Saturday, four years after Serena beat her sister Venus for the 2017 championship. Having long flown under the radar, 25-year-old Brady also reached the semi-finals of the US Open last year and said she hoped more was to come. “I hope I make it a habit,” she said on court. Hopefully I have a new habit of making finals.” Brady’s effort is more remarkable for having been one of the 72 players in hard quarantine before the tournament, unable to train on courts for five hours a day like the rest of the field. Despite the limited preparation, and a raft of taxing rallies against Pegula, there was no sign of her flagging in the heat.
