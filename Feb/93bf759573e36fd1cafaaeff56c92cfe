Kounde ran from his own penalty area, beat four Barca players and confidently fired past Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Rakitic, who left the Nou Camp at the end of August after winning 11 trophies with Barca, made sure with a thumping finish into the roof of the net. Lionel Messi could have snatched a late away goal but was denied by Bono. Julen Lopetegui's side saw out the win without conceding to take a big advantage into the second leg at the Nou Camp on March 3. Barcelona beat Sevilla 5-0 in the final three years ago. Athletic Bilbao, who could win the yet-to-be-played 2019-20 final in April, are in the second semi-final against Levante. --BBC--
