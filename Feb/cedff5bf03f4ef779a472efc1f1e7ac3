MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.15% but was still close to an all-time high. Shares in China rose 0.77%. Australian stocks erased gains to trade 0.05% lower, while Japan’s Nikkei was unchanged. E-mini futures for the S&P 500 fell 0.04%. Yields on two-year Treasuries hit a record low and the 10-year yield extended a pullback from a one-year high as a bond market sell-off started to fade. Strong United Sates (US) retail sales, new signs the Federal Reserve will maintain its accommodative stance, and an ongoing push for further US stimulus have bolstered economic optimism, but some analysts remain cautious because new strains of the coronavirus continue to emerge. “With an even larger stimulus package likely to be passed by Congress before the end of March, the US economic recovery could gain more momentum in 2021,” wrote Commonwealth Bank of Australia currency analyst Carol Kong. “Despite the recent positive vaccine developments, the global economic outlook remains uncertain partly because of the spreading virus variants.” On Wall Street, technology stocks fell, driving down the Nasdaq while other companies rose on broader economic optimism. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.29%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.03% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.58%. The MSCI’s global stock index fell 0.04% but was still near a record high. While investors eyed inflation, minutes from the January Fed meeting showed policymakers willing to push further accommodation to boost the pandemic-scarred US economy.
