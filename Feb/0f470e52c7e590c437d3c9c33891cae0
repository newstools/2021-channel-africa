Fagerson was punished for a dangerous clear out after his shoulder connected with Wyn Jones' head at the breakdown and has been banned for four weeks. Scotland lost 25-24, having led by two points when he was sent off. The 25 year old, likely to be in coach Warren Gatland's thoughts for the British and Irish Lions, misses games against France, Ireland and Italy. An independent disciplinary committee deemed the foul play warranted a mid-range entry point, a six week suspension but reduced that by two weeks to account for mitigating factors, including his admission of foul play and a good disciplinary record. Fagerson has the right to appeal. --BBC--
