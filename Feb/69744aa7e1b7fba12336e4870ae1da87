Ports of entry were closed in January 2021 as part of the on-going national lockdown, in an attempt to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Trucks crossing into Zimbabwe from South Africa have formed long queues since last week at Beitbridge, with some truck drivers worried that authorities will struggle to deal with long queues of trucks. Trucks are currently being prevented from travelling via the N1 to Louis Trichardt in Limpopo to Beit Bridge by traffic officials since the Border post in Musina is already congested. Traffic officials have established more than five holding spots for trucks between Louis Trichardt and the Beit Bridge Border post. Truck drivers have also complained about the lack of access to water, food and ablution facilities. --SABC--
