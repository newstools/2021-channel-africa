Francesco Rocca said he was very concerned by the conditions and warned of rising malnutrition. The government has been criticised for preventing humanitarian agencies from reaching victims of the conflict. It has promised greater aid access. After visiting the city of Mekelle, Rocca said those most in need of help were children, their mothers and the elderly. He said hospitals were lacking basic medical supplies and warned of rising levels of serious malnutrition. The President of the Ethiopian Red Cross Society said 80% of the Tigray region was still cut off from humanitarian assistance. Abera Tola warned that thousands could starve to death in the coming weeks. The government has been slow to allow help in. It doesn't control all of Tigray. But some analysts suggest stopping the food could be a tactic to push the rebels to surrender. --BBC--
