It comes in response to a proposed law which would make tech giants pay for news content on their platforms. Australians on Thursday woke up to find that Facebook pages of all local and global news sites were unavailable. Several government health and emergency pages were also blocked - something Facebook later asserted was a mistake. Those outside of the country are also unable to read or access any Australian news publications on the platform. The Australian government has strongly criticised the move, saying it demonstrated the "immense market power of these digital social giants". Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the ban on news information had a "huge community impact". About 17 million Australians visit the social media site every month.
