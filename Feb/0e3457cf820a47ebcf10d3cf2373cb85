The soldier, who asked to remain anonymous, is from the Tigrayan ethnic group. He said that since war broke out last November in Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray, Tigrayan soldiers have been discriminated against and targeted. "They disarmed us, announced a curfew after 10pm, and we were being watched over by our colleagues from the Amhara and Oromo ethnic group," he said. Another soldier told the BBC that they were also forbidden from watching any other TV channels apart from government ones. "We totally lost our freedoms," he said. On Tuesday a senior Ethiopian military official accused the 15 soldiers, who were part of a group of 169, of "tarnishing the image of the army and the country". "[They] were screaming and lying on the ground at Juba airport to cause chaos," said Major General Mohammed Tessema. He also accused the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, which is providing protection to the 15 soldiers, of "spreading disinformation": --BBC--
