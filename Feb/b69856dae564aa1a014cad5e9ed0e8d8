The effective date of the transaction was January 1, 2021. The decision was taken in response to a board and supervisory board strategy by the parent in July 2018, where a plan to simplify the group structure was adopted. Daimler Truck AG was selling almost 500 000 vehicles globally a year before the Covid-19 pandemic, but heavy commercial vehicle sales have plunged worldwide since then. The EU commercial vehicle market shrank 18.9 % to 1.7 million units in 2020, versus 2019, with sales in Germany down 14.8 %, said the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. In the US to end-December 2020, medium and heavy truck sales fell 22.3% in 2020 to 409 592 units year to date. In South Africa, medium and heavy commercial truck sales fell 22.5 and 18.8% respectively and motor manufacturers predict another challenging year. A statement from Mercedes-Benz South Africa on Friday said that the aim of the spin-off was to foster value creation for Daimler AG shareholders and to unlock the potential of the company.  --IOL--
