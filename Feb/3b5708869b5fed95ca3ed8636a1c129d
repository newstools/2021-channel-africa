The teachers have made several demands to the government, including seeking a Covid-19 risk allowance. President Lazarus Chakwera ordered schools to be closed five weeks ago following a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections and deaths. Schools were to reopen on Monday after a drop in the number of cases of coronavirus. Local media is reporting that most students returned home after reporting to school in the morning. In the town of Mponela, 65 kilometres north of the Capital, Lilongwe, learners closed roads with huge stones and tree branches to express solidarity with their teachers. Police have since dispersed the protest. The Teachers Union of Malawi wants teachers to be given personal protective equipment, training on how to deal with Covid-19 cases within their schools and a plan for social distancing in classrooms. Ministry of Education Spokesperson, Chikondi Chimala, said the government was holding meetings with teachersâ€™ representatives to resolve the issue. --BBC--
