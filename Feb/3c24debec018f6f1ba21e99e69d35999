The Trafficking in Persons Report released on Tuesday says poverty arising from lost jobs or other economic opportunities has, over the past year, increased the pool of people most vulnerable to being trafficked. “Millions of women, children and men worldwide are out of work, out of school and without social support in the continuing Covid-19 crisis, leaving them at greater risk of human trafficking. “We need targeted action to stop criminal traffickers from taking advantage of the pandemic to exploit the vulnerable,” said UNODC Executive Director, Ghada Waly. The warnings came even as the same document suggests countries, especially in the Sub-Saharan Africa region, had their agencies working hard, detecting trafficking incidents mostly before the victims crossed borders. According to an analysis in the report, an assessment of sub-Saharan African countries including Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia showed that there had been fewer incidents of domestic trafficking. But 75% of incidents detected involved victims destined to neighbouring countries, even though the police, immigration and other security agencies often foiled them on home soil. Children, trafficked for sexual exploitation, forced labour and begging, constituted 30% of all incidents observed in sub-Saharan Africa. This was also the time most countries on the continent shut down schools to control the pandemic. --TheEastAfrican--
