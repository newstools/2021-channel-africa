Several company executives who declined to be identified by name said they ultimately do not think the Biden administration will significantly soften the hard-line position. “Everyone is deflated,” said one company executive. Billions of dollars of United States technology and chip sales to Huawei hinge on how the Biden administration applies export restrictions the Trump administration put in place. The companies hope that with more time to make their cases before an interagency panel and a potential policy shift at least some of the rejected Huawei sales will be allowed. The Commerce Department did not respond to requests for comment. A Huawei spokesperson said the company does not have any insight into the licensing process at Commerce. Days before former President Donald Trump left office on January 20, the administration notified Huawei suppliers, including chipmaker Intel, that the government was revoking certain licenses to sell to Huawei and intended to reject dozens of applications for others, Reuters reported. The surprise flurry of “intent to deny” notices were among last-minute, tough-on-China moves aimed at boxing President Joe Biden into hard-line policies against Beijing and cementing Trump’s legacy. --Reuters--
