The UN agency says three million people, about half of Tigray's population, need food aid. Much of the region has remained cut off to humanitarian workers since Ethiopian government forces ousted the local leadership of the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front. The WFP says its response was requested by the government in Addis Ababa. Aid agencies have issued increasingly shrill warnings of widespread hunger in Tigray, despite official denials. Last week, the International Committee of the Red Cross described the scale of need as overwhelming. --BBC--
