Director General of Kenya Wildlife Service Brigadier John Waweru told the BBC that they intend to enforce the same tactics applied last year to end poaching. "Through my teams, I have enhanced anti-poaching and intelligence led operations as well as strengthening cooperation and intelligence with stakeholders, law enforcement agencies and local communities," he said. Waweru says the team was relying on intelligence to stop a poaching incident before it occurred. "When the Covid pandemic started we noticed some activities, as I said its intelligence led so we sort of have fillers of where would-be poachers would be operating from so what I did was to enhance operations to make sure we counter any move," he said. --BBC--
