Museveni, who was re-elected last week, will make a total of seven stops on his route. The President's victory lap comes amid calls for the government to lift the house arrest of opposition leader Robert Kyagulanyi, the pop star-turned politician popularly known as Bobi Wine, who has rejected the election results. The United States has called for a probe into allegations of election irregularities by the opposition, which have yet to file a petition. The opposition's offices were raided by the military and party officials say the material they were gathering for the petition was confiscated. --BBC--
