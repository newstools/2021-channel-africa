Diary Sow did not return to school after the Christmas holidays, causing concern in Senegal and France. Described as "the best student in Senegal", Sow won several national academic prizes and published her first novel last year. Aged 20, she has not been seen since January 4. Sow is a second-year pre-university student at the prestigious Parisian high school Lyc√©e Louis-Le-Grand, having received a scholarship for excellence. "She is a punctual, very serious student, and the alert was given quickly. Nobody saw her, we did not find her in her apartment" in a university residence in Paris, Henry Sarr, member of an association of Senegalese students who launched appeals on social networks, told the AFP news agency. "Neither her parents, nor her friends, guardian or the embassy have had any news," a member of the Senegalese community in Paris, Daouda Mbaye who organised a distribution of leaflets appealing for information at the weekend, told AFP. --BBC--
