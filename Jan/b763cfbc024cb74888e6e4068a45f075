COVAX, which is co-led by the GAVI vaccine alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO) and others, said the 1.8 billion doses would be supplied via an advance market commitment to 92 eligible countries and would correspond to approximately 27% coverage of populations in those countries. “Our forecasting indicates that we should fulfil the requests for vaccine placed by self-financing participants in the second half of 2021,” GAVI said in an updated forecast statement for COVAX. --Reuters--
