The National Unions of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and the South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) have lodged an urgent court application to declare unlawful the decision the BRPs have taken not to pay union members. The unions also say the BRPs who have received the R1.5 billion($98m) from the Department of Public Enterprises for the payment of salaries were given conditions before the money was paid out. They say this is in contravention of the Labour Relations Act. The unions say the BRPs paid outstanding salaries in December but refused to pay monies owed to their members. The SA Express liquidation case will also be heard at the South Gauteng High Court on Thursday morning. SAA BRPs have received the R2.8 billion($182m) as part of the R10.2 billion($664m) allocated in the budget to resuscitate the airline. SAA staff are also expected to be paid their Voluntary Severance PackageÂ  (VSP) on Friday. --sabc--
