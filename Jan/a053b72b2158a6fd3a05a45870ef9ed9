Benedict Ishabakaki told the BBC that the Tanzania-born activist reported to police as required in the morning but was later transferred to the immigration department. Tanzanian authorities are accusing Kay of not renouncing her Tanzanian citizenship by returning her passport after gaining Australian nationality. Dual citizenship is illegal in Tanzania. Her lawyer says that she did not return her Tanzanian passport because she lost it. "She is not using the Tanzanian passport. She entered Tanzania before her arrest using an Australian passport,” said her lawyer. The activist tweeted on December 28 that she was heading to the police station after “someone reported me in for blasphemy”.

She is the founder of Faithless Hijabi - a group which helps women who face recriminations for renouncing Islam.
