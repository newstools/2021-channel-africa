The tourists resumed on 98-2, chasing an unlikely 407 to win, and lost captain Ajinkya Rahane early on. Rishabh Pant countered with a sublime 97 and Cheteshwar Pujara dug in for 77 during an absorbing second session in which it seemed India could even pull off the third highest fourth-innings chase in Test history. But after both fell before tea to leave Australia needing five wickets in the final session, Hanuma Vihari and Ravichandran Ashwin battled superbly to survive 256 balls to steer India to 334-5 at the close. Vihari's unbeaten 23 off 161 balls was even more impressive given he batted for most of his innings with a hamstring injury, while Ashwin made 39 not out off 128 deliveries. Australia captain and wicketkeeper Tim Paine dropped three catches, while his vaunted fast bowlers and off-spinner Nathan Lyon toiled on a pitch that did not deteriorate as much as expected. The series remains level at 1-1 heading into the fourth and final Test in Brisbane starting on January 15. India, who were bowled out for 36 in the first-Test defeat, need only a draw to retain the Border-Gavaskar trophy, while Australia have not lost at the Gabba since 1988. This was an enthralling finale, but the third Test will also be remembered for allegations of racist abuse against India players by members of the crowd at the SCG. Cricket Australia said on Monday it could issue "indefinite" bans to any spectators found to have racially abused India players. --BBC--
