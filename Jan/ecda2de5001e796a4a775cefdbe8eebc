An image is going viral in Egypt of an exhausted nurse huddled on the ground after reportedly witnessing four COVID-19 patients die because the hospital didn't have enough oxygen to keep them alive. Doctors and nurses, as well as the head of al-Husseineya hospital in the governorate of Sharqia - have been summoned for questioning by local prosecutors. Egyptian officials have denied the reports, saying the patients died because of existing chronic conditions, not lack of oxygen. But with a similar incident reported at another hospital, anger is rising among Egyptians who accuse their government of failing to do enough to combat the pandemic, with the number of cases doubling in the past two weeks. --BBC--
