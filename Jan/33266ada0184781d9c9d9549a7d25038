Morgan recently rejoined Orlando Pride after a short spell at Women's Super League side Tottenham. The 31-year-old is a two-time World Cup winner and scored six goals at France 2019. "We are all in good spirits and recovering well," said Morgan on social media. "After our isolation is completed, I will follow US Soccer's return to play guidelines to ensure my body is fully recovered and I can join my team-mates back on the field soon." --BBC--
