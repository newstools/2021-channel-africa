A three-year-old Islamist insurgency in the south-eastern African nation’s Cabo Delgado province has intensified in recent months, with attacks occurring near Total’s concession area. The French company paused construction and began evacuating its staff this month. Mozambique is weighing offers from several countries, including France, Portugal and the United States, for help fighting the Islamic State-linked insurgents, whose attacks have left nearly 2500 people dead and caused 570 000 to flee their homes. The government wants to stop any disruptions to the gas investments that it expects will transform one of the world’s poorest countries. Gas production at the project Total is leading is planned to start in 2024. “We are working with Total to resume activities,” Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Max Tonela said. “There is still no indication of a change to the schedule.” Without a publicly announced plan on how to end the insurgency, the resumption of work could be delayed by months, according to Eurasia Group. --Herald--
