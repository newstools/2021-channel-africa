The WHO has posted a photograph of a Cham Wings aircraft it had used to ferry 16 tonnes of medicines and supplies from its warehouses in Dubai to Libya's second city Benghazi. The organisation's representative in Libya Elizabeth Hoff used to be its envoy to Syria for seven years from 2012. The Syrian private carrier was placed under US sanctions in 2016 for reportedly carrying weapons and foreign fighters to support President, Bashar al-Assad's, troops against rebels. Cham Wings is thought to be owned by Assad's brother-in-law. --BBC--
