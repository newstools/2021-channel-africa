More than 40 health workers tested positive for the virus over the weekend in the northern province of Nampula alone. Some 133 health professionals have contracted the virus in Nampula since last year, with no deaths recorded. Local officials say their major concern is that the health services are understaffed, with a poor doctor to population ratio. They fear that a rapid spread of the virus among health workers with see capacity collapse. Meanwhile, in the streets, not only of Nampula, but of the country as a whole, many people flout the rules on wearing a facemask, and there's overcrowding in public service offices and markets. --BBC--
