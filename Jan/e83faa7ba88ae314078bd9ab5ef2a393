The ministry said the operation was successful because it has a "robust system in the supply chain of weapons and ammunition from point of procurement to post-distribution", read a statement from the ministry. The government said investigations were ongoing to establish the origin and intended use of the weapons. The UN Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Somalia in January 1992. However, it has allowed light arms supplies to the Somali government forces. The development comes three months after the country's spy agency said it seized 79 tonnes of sulphuric acid smuggled into the country for use by al-Shabab militants. --BBC--
