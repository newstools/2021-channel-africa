Pattinson sustained the injury while on “approved leave” from the team’s hub in Melbourne following the Boxing Day test, which India won by eight wickets. He would not be replaced in the squad and would be assessed further before the fourth and final test in Brisbane, the team said in a statement. Pattinson did not play in the first tests, with selectors sticking with the pace attack of Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood. The series is level at 1-1 ahead of the third test which starts at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday. --Reuters--
