Republicans in the United States (US) Congress have indicated they are willing to work with President Joe Biden on his administration’s top priority, a $1.9 trillion US fiscal stimulus plan, but some are opposed to the price tag. Democrats took control of the US Senate on Wednesday, though they will still need Republican support to pass the program. But after record high closes on Wall Street Wednesday, markets in Asia reflected relief over an orderly transition of power and strong expectations that US stimulus will provide continued support for global assets. European shares were set to motor on, with pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures up 0.39%, German DAX futures 0.4% higher and FTSE futures up 0.6%. Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Capital Markets, said that Democratic control of the Senate “increases not just the probability of more fiscal (stimulus), but the magnitude.” “That means that this market should be way, way, way higher as a whole and we’re going to get there. We’re entering this regime of even more accelerated asset class inflation,” he said. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan touched record highs and was last up 0.92%, with markets across the region posting gains. --Reuters--
