Latest data by the Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) shows that medical insurance firms made about $8 million in underwriting profit over the half-year period, a record performance for the firms which have over the years posted losses. Tom Gichuhi, the Chief Executive of the Association of Kenya Insurers (AKI), attributed the performance on substantial reduction in claims payment due to reduced visits to hospitals. “Many people avoided going to hospitals for fear of contracting Covid-19. There was highly reduced traffic to hospitals and even those seeking elective surgeries were also postponing,” he said. “People were also working from home and therefore for simple ailments which could otherwise drive heavy traffic to hospitals, people avoided.” The $8 million profit was 3.2 times higher than the $2 million posted in the preceding half year, placing medical insurers on a strong footing to continue with the recovery from the $11 million loss they booked in 2018. Out of the 24 medical insurers, only seven posted underwriting losses, a big improvement from a similar period the previous year when 16 of the firms were in the red. Kenya reported the first Covid-19 case on March 13, prompting the State to impose measures such as a dusk-to-dawn curfew, social distancing and work-from-home calls. Medical claims paid during the six months fell by $3.6 million $97 million, marking the first time in over eight years they didn’t grow. Reduced hospital visits spared insurers’ huge bills, with official data showing that the cost of healthcare rose sharpest in October due to a surge in Covid-19 infections. Statistics by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) show that health inflation hit an all-time high of 3.04% in October from 0.05% at the start of last year. The incurred claims ratio dropped from 72.6% to 69%, compared to 83.9% seven years ago. Insurers had raised the alarm about high Covid-19 infections substantially raising medical bills. --TheEastAfrican--
