World number one Djokovic leads Serbia as they look to defend the title between February 1-5 in Melbourne. Nadal, ranked second, represents a Spain side aiming to avenge their defeat by Serbia in last year's final. US Open champion Dominic Thiem leads Austria, while ATP Finals champion Daniil Medvedev plays for Russia. Great Britain, who agonisingly missed out on the semi-finals in 2020, have not qualified for the 2021 event. Qualification is based on the ATP ranking of each country's top-ranked singles player, while hosts Australia have been given a wildcard.
