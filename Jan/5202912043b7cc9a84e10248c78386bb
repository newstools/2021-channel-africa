It comes at a time when the country is experiencing an uptick in militancy, gun attacks, robbery and kidnapping. The models seized include AK-47s, pistols, SKS, and shotguns, police said. Most of them were from the provinces of Nampula, Cabo Delgado, Niassa, Maputo, and the capital Maputo. The gas-rich northern Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado has been experiencing a three-year-old insurgency led by Islamist militants. The central provinces of Manica and Sofala have also experienced armed attacks led by a breakaway group of Mozambiqueâ€™s main opposition, Renamo. --BBC--
