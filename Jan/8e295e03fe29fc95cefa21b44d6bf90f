Reports have said athletes may have to quarantine ahead of the Tokyo Games, and with the Tour finishing less than a week before the scheduled road race, cyclists could face a tough choice. “We will see what’s going to happen this year. I cannot decide, we don’t know yet. But if I have to choose, for sure I will go for (the Tour de France) green jersey again,” said Sagan, speaking from a Bora-Hansgrohe team training camp near the Lago Di Garda, Italy. “But nobody knows what’s going to happen.” Sagan has won a record seven green jersey for the points classification on the Tour de France. He failed to secure it last year, however, after the cycling season went through a four-and-a-half-month hiatus amid the COVID-19 crisis. The 30-year-old Sagan, one of the most gifted riders of his generation, won three consecutive world championship road race titles in from 2015-17. --Reuters--
