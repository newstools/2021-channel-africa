Hundreds more have been injured during the unrest in El Geneina. A nearby camp for displaced people was also attacked during the worst violence since a peace deal was signed last October. International peacekeepers began a phased withdrawal from Darfur earlier this month. Reports say the violence began when an Arab man was stabbed to death by a man from a non- Arab group, leading to an exchange of gunfire. Sudan's government is sending reinforcements to the area to protect civilians. --BBC--
