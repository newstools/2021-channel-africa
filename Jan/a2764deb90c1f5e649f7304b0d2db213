A statement from the organisation does not provide reasons for the suspension. “The decision impacts all DSTV Diski Challenge fixtures with effect from this weekend until further notice.” Meanwhile, the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) will re-broadcast the second leg of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Champions League match this Sunday, 10 January at 15h00 on SABC 1. This follows the interruption of yesterday’s live broadcast of the match between Mamelodi Sundowns FC and Jwaneng Gala, 17 minutes into the second half, with Mamelodi Sundowns leading with 1-0. The match was initially scheduled to start at 16h00 but was delayed for 47 minutes, affecting the broadcasting channel’s initial schedule. This also resulted in the transmission of the match being cut short to cross over to the live SABC News bulletin, which had been rescheduled from 17h30 to 18h00 to accommodate the live broadcast of the match. “The SABC understands the public’s concerns and wishes to apologise for not being able to complete the broadcast of the CAFCL match, which Mamelodi Sundowns won 3 – 1, booking their spot in the group stages of the CAFCL,” says the public broadcaster in a statement. --SABC--
