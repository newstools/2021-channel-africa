In light of the fourth quarter performance, the Bank of France said it was sticking with a previous estimate that the euro zoneâ€™s second-biggest economy shrank 9% over the course of last year. The Central Bank also estimated the economy was operating this month down 7% from pre-crisis levels, unchanged from December but up from -11% in November when the country was under its second coronavirus lockdown. --Reuters--
