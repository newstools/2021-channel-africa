They expect the Reserve Banks’ Monetary Policy Committee (MPC ) to keep the key repurchase rate at its current 3.5%, when it makes its announcement on Thursday. However, a smaller number of economists anticipate a rate cut. The bank has repeatedly cautioned against the over-reliance on monetary policy to stimulate growth. Last year, it cut the repo rates by a cumulative 300 basis point in the face of a hard lockdown to deal with the first wave of COVID-19. The Central Bank has reiterated that growth and employment can only be lifted by significant structural reforms. The country currently is facing a fiscal and debt burden.  During its November MPC, the bank projected a smaller contraction for all of 2020 of 8% rather than the 8.2% estimate it gave in September. It also expected a massive third-quarter rebound. --SABC--
