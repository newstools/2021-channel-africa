Information Minister Abukar Osman Dubbe said the report relied on one side and did not collect any information from Somalia. The minister said the entire report is citing Kenya's Defence Minister Monica Juma. Dubbe said the report was released on January 25, which is the day deadly fighting erupted in Beled Hawo town, near the Kenya border. The Djibouti-led fact-finding special committee to resolve the diplomatic standoff between Kenya and Somalia was made up of a team formed by Djibouti President Ismael Guelleh. The team included diplomats and military chiefs. --BBC--
