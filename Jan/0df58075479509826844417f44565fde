The jihadist group has in recent days staged several attacks in the same region despite the government's claims of success against them. According to the mayor of Mozogo, Boukar Medjewe, local residents started fleeing to a nearby forest as soon as they heard that the attackers were approaching the town. A suicide bomber who hid among the fleeing civilians detonated explosives killing 11 people on the spot, before gunmen shot dead three others. The mayor said the military responded quickly but couldn't shoot at the militants who had mixed with the civilians. Many Cameroonians are questioning the government's claims of almost defeating the Islamist group.
