Civil Aviation Authority Chief, Ashraf Nowair, said Egypt had officially lifted the ban on Qatari flights, according to the Al-Ahram news site. The Gulf Co-operation Council and Egypt signed an agreement on January 5 that effectively restored ties with Qatar. So far, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have announced the reopening of their airspace to Qatari flights. In mid-2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and their ally Egypt had cut diplomatic, trade and travel ties with Qatar over accusations that it sponsored terrorism, which Qatar denied. --BBC--
