The violation occurred when the 76ers failed to list guard Ben Simmons on the team’s initial injury report for Saturday’s game against the Denver Nuggets. Simmons did not play in the game. Only seven Philly players logged minutes against the Nuggets after a bevy of players were sidelined by injury or health and safety protocols. --Field Level Media--
