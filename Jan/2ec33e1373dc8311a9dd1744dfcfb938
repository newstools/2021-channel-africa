BofA’s latest weekly fund flow data on Friday reflected some of that sentiment with investors storming into money markets and gold funds while pulling some money out of emerging markets, a recent winner which had attracted billions of dollars in the last 16 weeks. Still, United States (US) stocks stood out with $10 billion inflows. “Sell the Vaccine: frothy prices, greedy positioning, inflationary and desperate policy makers, peaky China and consumer all ultimately toxic brew in 2021,” Michael Hartnett, BofA’s chief investment strategist, said. The recent buying spree has sent US stock valuations soaring to 23 times 12-month forward earnings - levels it hit during the peak of the dotcom bubble in late 1990s - prompting Citi to downgrade the region to “neutral” from “overweight” on Thursday. Citi however was bullish on British and emerging market stocks, citing “reasonable” valuations. BofA said the 2020 trend to “buy everything” had trickled into 2021, but it expects a slowdown in risk assets as “policy, positioning and profits” peak around the first quarter. Goldman Sachs’ Chief Executive David Solomon said he was preparing for more stock market volatility, particularly in the near term, and currently sees some “excess in markets”, Axios reported on Thursday.
