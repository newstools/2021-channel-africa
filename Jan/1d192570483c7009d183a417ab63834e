Ilunga, a key ally of Tshisekedi's predecessor Joseph Kabila, had headed a coalition cabinet for 15 months. But members of parliament passed a vote of no confidence in his government on Wednesday and he was given 24 hours to resign. His resignation paves the way for Tshisekedi to appoint loyalists as ministers. Until now, Tshisekedi has been hamstrung by an alliance with Kabila that was agreed when he came into office two years ago. His victory in elections in December 2018 was hailed as a landmark moment, the first peaceful transfer of power in the vast country's almost six-decade history. Tshisekedi has yet to choose a new Prime Minister, who will form the next government. --BBC--
