Airlines are counting on COVID-19 vaccines to boost travel demand later this year but warn that the strength of a rebound will largely depend on the pace of vaccine rollouts, particularly as coronavirus cases keep rising. Chicago-based United said 2021 would be a “transition year that’s focused on preparing for a recovery.” Its shares fell 2% in after-hours trading. The company burned an average of $33 million per day in the fourth quarter, including about $10 million of severance and debt payments, even as it continued to slash costs. United furloughed thousands of employees last October when an initial round of payroll aid for airlines expired. It brought back those workers following a fresh $15 billion in payroll aid for the sector but warned the recall could be “temporary” as travel demand remains depressed. United is set to receive about $2.6 billion in payroll support through March 2020 and said it expects to offer employees options like voluntary leaves to reduce furloughs after that time. --Reuters--
