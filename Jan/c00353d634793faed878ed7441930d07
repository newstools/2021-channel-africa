United went behind early to Ademola Lookman's clinical finish but responded through Edinson Cavani's fourth away goal of the league campaign. Paul Pogba then sealed all three points with a stunning strike. "We've done better in tighter games. We've won loads of 1-0s and 2-1s. When you add those up at the end of the season it means many points," Solskjaer told reporters. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted his Manchester United side “needed a wake-up call” after a stunning Paul Pogba strike sealed a 2-1 victory at Fulham and sent them back to the top of the Premier League. The Cottagers took the lead after six minutes when Ademola Lookman turned the ball into the bottom corner. But United responded as Edinson Cavani capitalised on a... "That was a point we spoke about early on before the season had started, that we needed to stop getting draws and win more games. We've shown great improvement in mentality as well as physical robustness." Solskjaer's side are two points clear of Manchester City, who have played a game less. While much of the praise was reserved for Pogba, Solskjaer also hailed Cavani's influence since arriving on a free transfer in October after his contract at Paris St Germain expired. "Cavani is a centre forward you want in the box, his movement is incredible," Solskjaer said. "I almost get frustrated at times when he goes wide to put crosses in because he's the one you want in there. Sometimes I have to ask him to do less running. "He compliments Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood and Anthony Martial really well." United face Liverpool in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday before taking on Sheffield United in the league next Wednesday. --Reuters--
