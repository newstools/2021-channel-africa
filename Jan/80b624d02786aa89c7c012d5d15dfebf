The investigation will assess whether the proposals could cause advertising spend to become even more concentrated on the ecosystem of Alphabet’s Google at the expense of its competitors, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Google has said the technology, referred to as the ‘Privacy Sandbox’ project, will allow people to receive relevant ads, helping to sustain the current advertising model without tracking users on an individual level. “As the CMA found in its recent market study, Google’s Privacy Sandbox proposals will potentially have a very significant impact on publishers like newspapers, and the digital advertising market,” CMA Chief Executive Officer Andrea Coscelli said. The CMA said it had received complaints from Marketers for an Open Web (MOW), a coalition of technology and publishing companies, which allege that Google is “abusing its dominant position” through the proposals. Web browsers such as Mozilla and Apple Inc’s Safari have already blocked third-party cookies. “Creating a more private web, while also enabling the publishers and advertisers who support the free and open internet, requires the industry to make major changes to the way digital advertising works,” a Google spokeswoman said.
