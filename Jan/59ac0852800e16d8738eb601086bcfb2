South Sudan's Foreign Ministry had formally complained to Kenya requesting for special consideration. The Director for African affairs in the ministry, Dominic Gum, said those intending to travel to Kenya can now get visas from its embassy in the capital, Juba. “Each visa applicant must have a negative Covid certificate and yellow fever vaccination certificate. “These are the requirements for all South Sudanese travellers to Kenya. For the Kenyan citizens who are coming to South Sudan, they should do the same, get the normal visa from our embassy in Nairobi,” Gum is quoted as saying by the national broadcaster South Sudan Broadcasting Corporation. Many South Sudanese travel to Kenya for study and business. --BBC--
