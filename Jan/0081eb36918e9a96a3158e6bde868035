Much of downtown D.C. remains a ghost town with dozens of roads blocked off with security checkpoints and armed police and troops on standby. Presidential inaugurations are always tightly secure events with operations led by the US Secret Service, but in 2021 measures have been amped up after outgoing President Donald Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on January 6 in a bid to prevent the final certification of Bidenâ€™s victory. Law enforcement officials have warned of threats and armed groups in all 50 states. US officials said last week they expected the number of National Guard troops to rise to 25 000 in Washington D.C., a number that could still increase even further. Starting from Tuesday, fences have been erected along the roads around the White House and Pennsylvania Avenue, with National Guard soldiers on duty at every crossing. The area for the inauguration has been fully closed, with the security system on full alert. The crossings around the area have been secured with checkpoints and dozens of National Guard soldiers. On the day, vehicle traffic was prohibited or limited with only few reporters on the street in the area. --Reuters--
