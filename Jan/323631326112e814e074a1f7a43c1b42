On Monday, the electoral commission declared President Faustin-Archange Touadera the winner of the race, with voter turnout of over 76% despite an offensive by rebel groups seeking to derail the vote. However, only half of the country’s 1.8 million eligible voters were able to register for the vote due to the violence. Ten of the 17 candidates are now rejecting this result, saying turnout of registered voters was just 37% and that the insecurity disrupted campaigning and the electoral process. “We demand an annulment pure and simple and a rerun of the election,” they said in the statement. There was no immediate comment from the electoral commission or Touadera. A disputed election could further destabilise the gold and diamond producer, whose population of 4.7 million has endured waves of militia violence since 2013 that has killed thousands and forced more than a million from their homes. A powerful coalition of opposition politicians has also called for the vote to be repeated, including former president, Francois Bozize. Touadera and the United Nations, which has over 12,800 uniformed peacekeepers in CAR, have accused Bozize of being behind the rebel offensive, which briefly seized the country’s fourth-largest city ahead of the election.
