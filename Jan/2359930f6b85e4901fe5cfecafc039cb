The attacks were carried out on Monday and Tuesday. The report quotes "reliable sources" as saying that 130 civilians were killed by Gumuz gunmen in various districts in Metekel Zone on Monday. "The area residents who were collecting the bodies told ESAT that during the Dibate District attack, the armed bandits were only targeting the houses of Amhara and Agew nationals and killed (many), including women and children. They also said that the number could rise," the report said. In December, more than 200 people were killed in an ethnic attack in the same region. The incident took place hours after Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, visited the region to assess the security situation. Security forces killed 42 of the attackers in a subsequent operation as the authorities placed several districts in the region under military control. Instability in Benishangul-Gumuz poses a threat to the controversial Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, whose operationalisation has been the subject of tense negotiations between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan for nearly a decade. --BBC--
