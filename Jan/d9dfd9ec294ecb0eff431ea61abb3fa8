South Africaâ€™s cricket coach, Mark Boucher, says they will use the few days before their first test match of the two-match series against Pakistan later this month, to adapt to the conditions in that country. The Proteas have departed for the country on the Asian sub-continent where they will play a two-match test series starting on the 26th of this month and a three-match T20 series next month. With the Proteas touring Pakistan for the first time in 14 years, the main concern is the conditions in that country which most of the current Proteas players would not have been exposed to or played in. And with the Pakistan bowlers regarded as masters of reverse-swinging of the cricket ball, Boucher says they will use the few days ahead of their first test to practice playing reverse swing. --SABC--
