The two competing beers both have large fan bases and are loved and consumed widely. Liberian sports authorities say they selected Heineken because its management offered more cash to help with the event’s planning. “The fact of the matter is our sponsorship between these two competitors was purely on the basis of the higher bidder,” Youth and Sports Minister, Zeogar Wilson, told the BBC. “Tsingtao could only afford $10 000 and Heineken came up with $15 000 plain and simple.” But Liberian agents of the Chinese beer have described their exclusion as a deliberate attempt to make business difficult for their product. They have argued in a series of radio appearances that the authorities did not appreciate the employment they have created for hundreds of citizens which has boosted the economy. The foreign beer competition has put pressure on Liberia’s own traditional Club Beer to improve its quality and introduce new and better brands on billboards in recent times. The National County Meet, which involves male and female football matches, is the most popular social event in the country. --BBC--
