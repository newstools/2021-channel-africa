The announcement was made by Portugal’s Foreign Minister, Augusto Santos Silva, who is on a three-day visit to Mozambique representing the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell. After meeting President Filipe Nyusi, Santos Silva said the president had been very clear in identifying the areas where increased security co-operation could immediately benefit Mozambique. Humanitarian assistance for the population of the northern province of Cabo Delgado, which has been under attack from militants since October 2017, driving an estimated 570 000 people from their home, was also mentioned. The Portuguese diplomat said EU support might also be extended to the Agency for the Integrated Development of the North, a recently established body intended to drive the development of all three northern provinces, namely Cabo Delgado, Niassa and Nampula.
