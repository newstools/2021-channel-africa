Most of them had been abducted from the island of Matemo last week, Police Chief, Bernardino Rafael said. Recent fighting meant the security forces knew where the militants were located, so with the assistance of helicopters they were able to track down and isolate the abductees, he said. They will be taken back to Matemo, which has suffered militant attacks since October. But the police chief said the island was now safe. The militants, known locally as al-Shabab, or the youth, have launched a series of attacks on villages and towns in the area over the past three years More recently they have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, and are known for their gruesome attacks, which include the beheading of villagers and the torching of houses. They tend to kidnap women and children, who are used as sex slaves and to transport looted goods following attacks. Over the weekend, the United States (US) Defence Department said that Anthony Tata, its acting under Secretary for Policy, had visited Mozambique last Friday to hold meetings with government ministers about the importance of a strategic plan to bring stability to Cabo Delgado. A statement from the US embassy says it will disburse $42 million for humanitarian and socio-economic development projects in the northern region. These efforts and others, according to Ambassador, Dennis Hearne, are part of the $500 million annual assistance given to the Mozambique by the US. --BBC--
