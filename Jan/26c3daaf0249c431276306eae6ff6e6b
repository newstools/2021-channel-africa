Lieutenant General, Mohamed Hamdan "Hemeti" Dagolo, did not specify which type of vaccines would be provided or how many, however both the Chinese Sinopharm and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines have so far been approved for use in the UAE. Hemeti, one Sudan's most powerful military commanders, has close ties with the UAE. According to the Darfur24 website, Prime Minister, Abdalla Hamdok said about a month ago that Sudan would receive 8.4 million doses of a COVID vaccine, but he did not specify which one or where they would come from. The Health Ministry then said it expected their arrival before April, the report says. Sudan, which has an estimated population of 39.5 million, recently set a new infection record in Khartoum State with 110 new COVID-19 cases and nine deaths. The new figures bring the total number of infections in Sudan to more than 23 300, including 1 468 deaths. Radio Dabanga reports that there are growing concerns about the number of unrecorded and undetected cases in the country. --BBC--
