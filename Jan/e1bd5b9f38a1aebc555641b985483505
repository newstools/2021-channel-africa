Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga, who is Acting Health Minister, made the announcement on national television. "The President fully appreciates the difficulties that come with this extension, livelihoods are being disrupted - yet we must save lives and our nation." A 30-day level-four lockdown began on January 5, following a surge in infections over the festive season. Only essential services, including hospitals, pharmacies and supermarkets are being allowed to operate. Restrictions include a stay-at-home order, a curfew and a ban on the sale of alcohol. Correspondents say the virus has overwhelmed Zimbabwe's chronically underfunded health system. Last week, two Cabinet Ministers died after contracting coronavirus. --BBC--
