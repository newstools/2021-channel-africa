The outbreak is in a poultry farm where 58 000 deaths out of 100 000 have been reported. The farm is in the city of Thi√®s, about 70 kilometres from the capital Dakar. In the notification sent on Thursday to the World Organisation for Animal Health, authorities specified birds in contact with proven cases were culled. They also said that poultry were kept in closed buildings away from homes. Surveillance measures continue. The source of the outbreak remains unknown. Since 2005, Senegal has banned poultry imports as a preventive measure against bird flu. The Senegalese Poultry Producers Association says the sector generated about $280 million. --BBC--
