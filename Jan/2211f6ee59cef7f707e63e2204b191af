The Craft Brewers Association of South Africa has conducted a survey, showing that a large number of liquor traders are experiencing dire financial situations under the current lockdown restrictions. Under the adjusted Alert Level 3 lockdown, the sale, distribution and transportation of alcohol have been banned. Basa CEO Patricia Pillay has called on government to consider easing the total ban on the sale of alcohol. “There is an expiry to beer. So, remember every time that we get locked down, it affects the stock that we have on hand. With not knowing with the last lockdown, the stock that we had on hand for the new year is now close to expiring, which has to be discarded. What we have put forward is to say that at least increase the off-consumption sales of alcohol and allow that to happen and keep some ban in place in terms of curfew as well as social gatherings,” says Pillay. 

Basa also says the ban on alcohol does more harm to the economy than good.
