Mahamat Said Abdel Kani was handed over to the ICC on Sunday by authorities in the Central African Republic. Presiding judge Rosario Salvatore Aitala will use Thursday's session to verify the former rebel leader's identity and the language he prefers to use in following proceedings. He will be informed of the charges against him and his rights under the ICC Rome Statutes. A limited number of people will be allowed in the courtroom due to Covid-19 health measures, but the session will be broadcast live on the ICC website in French, English and Sango.
