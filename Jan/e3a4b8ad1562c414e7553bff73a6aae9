He will take over the Secretary General role from incumbent President Evariste Ndayishimiye, who held the post until May 2020 when he won the election. Ndikuriyo took to Twitter after the vote on Sunday to thank “companion” Ndayishimiye and said he “will not betray” the party. He joined the then rebel group in early 1990s before it turned into a political movement and eventually won power in 2003 after the Arusha peace agreement. The 50 year-old former Makamba province governor is known to be outspoken and straight forward in his speeches. --BBC--
