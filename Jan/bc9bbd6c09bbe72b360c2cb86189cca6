Appointments have been made for health workers and citizens are registering online to receive the vaccine in 3000 locations, said Ben Azouz Mohammed, head of the ministry’s vaccination programme. Morocco on Friday received 2 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by India’s Serum Institute and it expects to get 500 000 doses of vaccine from China’s Sinopharm on Wednesday. The virus has hit Morocco hard, shrinking the economy by 7.2% last year according to the International Monetary Fund, with unemployment surging to almost 15% as nearly three quarters of a million jobs were lost. Friday’s vaccine delivery followed weeks of delays, with Moroccan officials repeatedly promising the imminent start of the roll-out from December. Rabat has placed orders for 66 million doses, with 25 million from AstraZeneca and the rest from Sinopharm as it targets the vaccination of 25 million people, four fifths of its population over three months. However, with increasing global competition for vaccine doses, Morocco’s ability to roll out a wide scale national programme depends on a steady flow of supply, Mohammed said. --Reuters--
