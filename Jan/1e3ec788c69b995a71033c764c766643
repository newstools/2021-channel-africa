The ministry added in a statement that it was working with the country’s health regulator South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) to ensure there were no delays with the rollout of the vaccines.

South Africa will vaccinate 40 million people or two-thirds of its population against COVID-19 in order to achieve herd immunity, its health minister said on Thursday, as a mutant variant drove daily new cases above 21 000 for the first time. A more contagious coronavirus mutant, first found on South Africa’s east coast late last year, is driving a second wave of infections across Africa's most industrialised nation, pushing its total to 1.15 million, a third of all the continent’s cases. This week, deaths in South Africa surpassed 30 000, and Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said both private and public hospitals were struggling to manage to a growing influx of patients. “Deaths and admissions are already higher than what we have ever experienced before,” he said in virtual presentation to parliament. Mkhize proposed vaccinating the 40 million people over a year -- without saying when they would start -- a goal he admitted was “a huge task”, given the country’s capacity in terms of staff and facilities.
