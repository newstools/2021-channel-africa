Chairperson Moussa Faki tweeted that peace at the border was important for regional stability. Fighting broke out at Baled-Hawo, a town in the south-western region of Gedo in Somalia, on Sunday night. Somalia has accused Kenya for being behind the attacks. Kenya has however denied any involvement in the border clashes and called for the AU to intervene. The federal government and Jubbaland's administration have been disputing the process for elections and control of some regions bordering Kenya. Somalia in December 2020 severed diplomatic relations with Kenya after accusing Nairobi of “blatant interference” in Jubbaland affairs. Kenya denied the accusation.
