The first batch would contain 100 000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, obtained through the global vaccine-sharing scheme known as Covax. Nigeria will first inoculate frontline health workers, first responders, national leaders, people vulnerable to coronavirus and the elderly, Mr Shuaib said. The country hopes to get 42 million vaccines to cover one-fifth of its population through the scheme, Shuaib added. The World Health Organization set up the Covax scheme to help poorer countries obtain Covid-19 vaccines amid widespread concerns that wealthier nations would snap them up. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said last week that the country expected to get vaccines through Covax scheme by the second quarter of 2021, following the initial payment of $19.3 million. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize subsequently said that the government was also in talks with private pharmaceutical companies to obtain vaccines by January. South Africa's government has been under intense pressure to roll out an inoculation programme following the discovery of a faster spreading variant of the virus. South Africa has recorded more than 1.1 million Covid-19 cases, the highest in Africa. Nigeria has so far recorded close to 100 000 cases. More than 1 200 new cases were recorded on Monday, its highest ever. Nigeria has a population of abut 200 million, the biggest in Africa.
