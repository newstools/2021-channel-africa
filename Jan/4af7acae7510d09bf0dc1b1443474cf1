The militia group has been reportedly mobilised to stop the holding of partial election. Local media reported that commanders of the militia have threatened that they will act if the government begins the electoral process in Mogadishu without agreement. These threats come after the federal government over the weekend said it will hold the disputed election without the participation of Jubbaland and Puntland states and other candidates. The decision led to concern about the existence of the system of governance in Somalia. --BBC--
