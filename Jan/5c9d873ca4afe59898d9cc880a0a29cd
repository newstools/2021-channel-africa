Gebremeskel Kassa, a senior official in the interim administration in Tigray appointed by the federal government, made the comments in an interview broadcast by state-run ETV’s Tigriniya language channel late on Tuesday. The figure given by the official was more than double a previous estimate for the number of people displaced of 950 000, which included 50 000 who had fled to neighbouring countries. Ethiopia’s federal government restricted access to Tigray after fighting began on November 4 between its troops and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), a political party that was governing the province. 

The government declared victory in late November though the TPLF has vowed to fight on. The conflict in Tigray has called into question whether Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, can hold together fractious ethnic groups in the country. An official from Ethiopia’s National Disaster Risk Management Commission told Reuters on Wednesday that the figures cited by the administrator in Tigray were not official. The commission’s Mitiku Kassa said 110 000 people were displaced within Tigray and 1.8 million were in need of assessment, though he said the actual number of displaced was likely to be far higher than its current tally.
