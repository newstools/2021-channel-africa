Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe said the vaccines were ordered through an African Union (AU) initiative. The United Kingdom Foreign minister, Dominic Raab, who is in the country for a one-day visit, is quoted as saying Britain was helping Kenya to prepare to roll out the vaccine. "It is for us not just our moral duty, but in the British national interest to see Kenyans vaccinated just as soon as we physically, logistically can," Raab is quoted as saying. Kenya has a population of about 48 million, according to a 2019 population census. It has so far confirmed 99 308 coronavirus cases and 1Â 130 707 tests. There have been 82 478 recoveries and 1 734 deaths. --BBC--
