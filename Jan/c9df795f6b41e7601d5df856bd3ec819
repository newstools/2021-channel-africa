Macron said the arrival of Special Forces from other European countries would allow France to make changes. He made no reference to a time frame on the proposed changes, but a decision is expected to be taken at a forthcoming summit of France and G5 Sahel countries to be held in February in Chad's capital, N'Djamena. The French President assured that efforts to maintain stability and victory against the jihadists will be maintained. More than 5 000 French troops have been serving as part of Operation Barkhane in support of the forces of Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad. However, they face a growing insurgency by jihadist groups, which have significantly stepped up their attacks in the Sahel countries since in 2020. France is relying heavily on the deployment of a joint force of European troops, Takuba, whose objective is to accompany the Malian army in combat. With the presidential election scheduled for 2022, impatience is growing in France as the operation in the Sahel is perceived as long and costly. It has cost the lives of 50 French soldiers so far. --BBC--
