The races were first and third on the 2021 calendar and the season is now scheduled to begin with the second race, in Bahrain, on March 26. Both Australia and China have strict rules on international arrivals. The Australian Grand Prix, originally scheduled for March 19-21, will now take place between November 19 and 21. A race at Imola in Italy has been added from April 16-18. "We are pleased to confirm that the number of races planned for the season remains unchanged," F1 President, Stefano Domenicali, said. "The global pandemic has not yet allowed life to return to normal, but we showed in 2020 that we can race safely as the first international sport to return and we have the experience and plans in place to deliver on our season." The dates of the Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi events have been moved to accommodate the postponed Australia race. Brazil moves forward one week to November 7, while the latter two have been pushed back a week to December 5 and 12 respectively. F1 says discussions over a new date for the Chinese Grand Prix, which was meant to be held from April 9-11, are ongoing. Only 17 of the 22 scheduled F1 races went ahead in 2020 while the 2021 season is due to have a record 23 races. Imola, an historic F1 venue which held a grand prix for 27 consecutive years from 1980, hosted its first race since 2006 in November 2020. "It is great news that we have already been able to agree a rescheduled date for the Australian Grand Prix in November and are continuing to work with our Chinese colleagues to find a solution to race there in 2021 if something changes," Domenicali added. "Obviously, the virus situation remains fluid, but we have the experience from last season with all our partners and promoters to adapt accordingly and safely in 2021." --BBC--
