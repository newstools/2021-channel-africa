Ambassador Natalie Brown says the commission provided no explanation for its decision despite multiple requests. She said in a statement that only "a small, randomly selected handful of our observers" were approved from a team of 88 observers. "Absent the robust participation of observers, particularly Ugandan observers who are answerable to their fellow citizens, Ugandaâ€™s elections will lack the accountability, transparency and confidence that observer missions provide," she added. Ugandans will be electing a new parliament and president in the election. President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power for 35 years, will be seeking a sixth term. --BBC--
