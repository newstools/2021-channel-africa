The consignment is the second batch to arrive in Morocco after 2 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by India’s Serum Institute. The government has announced that it will first start vaccinating health, security, and teaching staff this week and has launched a website for other people to register for the vaccine. The country signed a deal with Sinopharm in August which involved conducting clinical trials in Morocco as well as announcing plans to set up a production plant. King Mohammed VI and China’s President had also discussed vaccine cooperation and in September Morocco agreed a deal to buy AstraZeneca vaccine doses. Morocco plans to vaccinate 25 million people, or 80% of its population, within three months. However, with increasing global competition for vaccine doses, Morocco’s ability to roll out a wide scale national programme depends on a steady flow of supply, Health Ministry officials said. By Tuesday, Morocco had recorded 467 493 coronavirus cases, including 8 187 deaths and 14 483 active cases. --Reuters--
