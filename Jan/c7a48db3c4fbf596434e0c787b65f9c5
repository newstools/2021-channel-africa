Tladi was paying tribute to the world-renowned jazz musician and opera singer who died on Thursday at the age of 63. Her family says she passed away in hospital from stroke-related complications. Throughout her career, she was awarded many accolades including The Order of Ikhamanga bestowed on her by former President Thabo Mbeki. Tladi says, “Sibongile was a lovely person, she as a lady. You know when I booked her for a show, we used to sit and discuss what she’s going to do, she didn’t just walk through to the show and she used to call me, eish wena you are strict … it’s so sad, I’m shocked, I can’t believe she was very humble and she had continuously said to me ‘the music that she’s singing, the people of South Africa owns that music’.” Difficult Legendary jazz musician Sipho Hotsitx Mabuse says he finds her death difficult to comprehend. Family spokesperson Bandile Mngoma says she died in hospital and it was not COVID-19-related. It is with great sadness we learn of the passing of Mam’ @Sibo_Khumalo. A talent reservoir, whose voice has reverberated through time and space. The music industry has truly lost a formidable legend. May her soul rest in perfect peace. — SAMRO (@SAMROMusic) January 28, 2021 My deepest sympathies and condolences to the Khumalo and the Mngoma family. To Tshepo and Ayanda no words I can say now can take away the pain. She was daughter, my friend and my colleague. I am devastated. Rest in Peace sanalwam.
