Musa Hassan Bility, once Head of the Liberia Football Association, was slapped with a 10-year FIFA ban and fined $500Â 000 in 2019. The international football governing body found Bility guilty of misappropriating FIFA funds. An influential petroleum importer and dealer, Bility was elected unopposed as Chairperson of the Liberty Party at its convention last weekend. His election has dominated radio discussions in the capital, Monrovia, for days, with callers lashing out at the party for choosing a man they say has a tainted character internationally. Efforts to get Bility on phone for comment failed. A party Spokesperson, Daniel Sando, said the criticism was a conspiracy by the ruling party and said the Liberty Party was unapologetic for electing Bility. After the FIFA ban was announced, Bility said he was going to challenge the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sports. It is not clear how the case has proceeded since then. --BBC--
