He said the "emirs of the gulf countries" gave him 60 gold bars which he sold in an underground market. The former Prime Minister also admitted not declaring the proceeds to tax authorities. Ouyahia was last in government as Prime Minister between 2017- 2019 but his lingering reputation is from the 90s when he implemented austerity measures. He famously told Algerians that "people do not need to eat yogurt" in response to opponents contesting his tough economic measures. Ouyahia along with other senior officials who served under ousted President Abdelaiz Bouteflika have been prosecuted and jailed for corruption, money laundering and misappropriation of public funds. But he's currently appealing a charge of corruption and misappropriation of public fund in relation to a scandal involving a car assembling group. --BBC--
