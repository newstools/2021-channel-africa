Heavy gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades hit a military convoy in Gazagana village, in the north-eastern state of Yobe on Saturday. The army initially said that only one soldier had died and 28 jihadists had been, in its words, neutralised. The Islamic State West Africa Province group (Iswap) split from the Boko Haram group in 2016 and carries out regular attacks on soldiers in Yobe, with the violence spilling over into neighbouring Borno state. --BBC--
