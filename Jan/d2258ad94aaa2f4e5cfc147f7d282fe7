Following are investor comments after a tumultuous day in United States (US) politics. “It’s basically a reflation trade. Anything that benefits from rising prices is going to do well. “The market had a one-way bet that the Republicans were going to win both seats in the Georgia runoff...but as we found out that didn’t happen, and that changes a lot. “The reason why there’s a reflation trade is when you look at the policy settings they are trying to get through, it’s about printing to the Main Street and not Wall Street. “Taxes and regulations will go up, but they will be printing a lot more money and giving a lot more support for consumer spending, so it favours the domestic economy over support for corporate profits. “A huge amount of money has come out of the bond market. Even though only a portion of that went into equities, it’s jammed up equities. When passive money moves around this is what happens.”
