Victoria state police minister Lisa Neville said two players and a non-playing Australian Open participant comprised three new infections reported on Wednesday. A total of 10 people associated with the Grand Slam, including four players, have now tested positive for the virus. There has been some confusion over the exact numbers, with authorities’ test results later being reclassified as “viral shedding” from previous infections. The viral shedders are not contagious. Neville said authorities were “very confident” one of the two new player infections was a case of viral shedding. “Of the other two, it’s less clear that they’re shedding. That will be worked through, and that’s one player and one support person,” Neville told reporters. Australian Open Tournament Director, Craig Tiley, said two players reported to have tested positive on Tuesday were also viral shedders.
