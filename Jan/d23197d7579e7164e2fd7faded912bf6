The association says the industry also faces challenges of high demand for coffins and an increase in policy cancellations.   

Tshipi-Noto funeral home started in Delmas, Mpumalanga and has been in business for 19 years, however, the General Manager at the funeral home, says the years of experience couldn’t prepare them for the COVID-19 pandemic.    

Tshipi-Noto General Manager Thabiso Moumakoe says, “We are all scared of the virus, we’ve seen the impact of the virus, and the people that are coming into our offices are aware that this is a different variant. This one is a bit more aggressive so just like everybody else we are sacred as a business…”   

“We are scared as human beings not only for ourselves but also for our families. We are also battling to get a choice or variety of coffins. We get whatever they have, we just take and hopefully our clients are comfortable with what we have,” added Moumakoe.  

He says the start of the New Year is usually the least busy time of the year, but considering the country’s current state, employees say they are bracing themselves for more burials.   

Funeral undertakers have pinned their hopes on South Africa getting the COVID-19 vaccine. NFPASA says their affiliates are losing staff to the virus.
