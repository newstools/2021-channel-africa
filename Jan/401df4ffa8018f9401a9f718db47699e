The 13-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped 25.59 million barrels per day (bpd) in December, the survey found, up 280 000 bpd from November and a further increase from a three-decade low reached in June. OPEC output is set to rise further in January after OPEC+ - which groups OPEC and other producers including Russia - agreed to ease output cuts. Under a deal on February output agreed on Tuesday, most of OPEC+ will keep production steady while Saudi Arabia has offered to make a big voluntary cut. “The additional production cut by Saudi Arabia will probably prevent the oil market from becoming oversupplied, which risked happening otherwise,” said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank, referring to the first quarter. In December, the biggest supply increase came from Libya, an OPEC member which is exempt from OPEC+ cuts, the survey found. Libyan output had been largely shut down for months due to unrest.
