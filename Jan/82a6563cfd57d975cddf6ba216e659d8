Initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 787 000 for the week ended January 2, compared to 790 000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 800 000 applications in the latest week. Elevated claims are in line with other data that have suggested the economy was taking a beating from business restrictions and retrenchment in consumer spending because of the pandemic. 

Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s December 15-16 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers expected soaring coronavirus cases “would be particularly challenging for the labor market in coming months.” Covid-19 cases in the United States (US) have jumped to more than 21 million, with the death toll exceeding 352 000 since the virus first emerged in China in late 2019, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A report on Wednesday showed private companies shed workers in December for the first time in eight months. Data from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed a steep decline in the number of employees working in December compared to November 2020. 

The reports raised the risk that the economy lost jobs in December, though a survey this week showed factory employment rebounding in December.
