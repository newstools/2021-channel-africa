President, Faustin-Archange Touadéra, said the curfew would be in place from 20:00 local time to 05:00, but it's unclear who long it will last. Touadéra won a second term in December in a disputed election. Fighting has continued in towns nationwide, with the rebels threatening to march on the capital, Bangui. The government has accused the former President, François Bozizé, who was barred from standing in the poll, of staging an attempted coup. Bozizé has denied the allegations but said he supported the rebels. Prosecutors have launched an investigation, accusing Bozizé of acts of destabilisation and rebellion. --BBC--
