The Indian Ocean archipelago confirmed 16 new cases on Sunday evening, three of which were reported on its second most populous island of Praslin. Seychelles, composed of 115 islands, registered its first case of COVID-19 on 14 March 2020. It has so far recorded 322 cases and 223 recoveries. The government last week imposed restrictions, including ordering the closure of churches, bars, gyms and schools, following a rise in infections. There are also travel restrictions and businesses are encouraged to operate virtually, except for essential services. --BBC--
