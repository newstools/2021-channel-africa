“The Tanzania Wildlife Management Authority (TAWA) invites applications from qualified applicants for the allocation of Tourist Hunting Blocks through electronic auctioning” the authority says on its website. Tawa has set out requirements for companies interested in the blocks, including being registered “within Tanzania intending to engage in hunting of animals”, as well having at least one director with five years of experience in wildlife-based business and conservation in the country. “Eligible hunting companies can be allocated up to five hunting blocks each, which shall be of different categories. Auctioning will commence on February 8 2021 and will last for seven consecutive days” the authority says. Some of the hunting blocks are located within the Selous Game Reserve ecosystem, which is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Tourism is one of the key pillars of Tanzanian economy. The government initially placed 26 hunting blocks on an online auctioning platform in 2019 in order to enhance transparency and curb corruption. Last year’s auction was reportedly shelved after the government was unable to sell many of the blocks in previous auctions. --BBC--
