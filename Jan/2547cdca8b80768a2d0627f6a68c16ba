The Spanish champions were humiliatingly knocked out of the Copa del Rey in the last 32 by third division Alcoyano on Wednesday. Newspaper AS called it "one of the most embarrassing pages in Real's history. Their idea is to take a big decision after the season," said Balague. "Zidane has come back from the brink several times before, even this campaign, but the team seems to have hit a wall." The 2-1 defeat by Alcoyano, who played the final 10 minutes of extra time with 10 men, was the latest worrying result for Real. Zidane returned last season and guided them to a first league title in three years, having previously led them to three consecutive Champions League successes, one league title, two Club World Cups and two Uefa Super Cups in his first spell in charge. But this season they are four points behind leaders Atletico Madrid - who have two games in hand - and looked less than convincing during the Champions League group stage. "He's a legend of the club and they will wait to see how it progresses - they don't want to accelerate that because it's not a guarantee of anything," added Balague. "But the disappointment is not just because of results, though those have not been good. They lost to Cadiz and Shakhtar Donetsk at home, lost 4-1 against Valencia, lost to Alaves at home, Shakhtar away and Athletic Bilbao in the semi-finals of the Super Cup and now Alcoyano as well. "These are bad results but the disappointment is more than that. There are two things the Real hierarchy are a bit annoyed about.‚Äù --BBC--
