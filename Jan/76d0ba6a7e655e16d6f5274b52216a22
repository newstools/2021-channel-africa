The Communications Workers Union (CWU) and Broadcasting, Electronics and Media Workers Union (Bemawu) took to the streets on Wednesday, to embark on the first leg of this week’s protests. Unions are pleading with the government to put an end to the Section 189 process and are also calling for the complete removal of the broadcaster’s current board. SABC workers once again gathered at their usual meeting spot on Wednesday – this time set on taking matters further than before.  The employees led a procession to the Union Buildings in Pretoria, bringing the M1 North to a standstill. Joined by other organisations who are in solidarity with grieving employees, the crowd finally made its way to the building’s gates, where the memorandum would be delivered. “The President before he took over, promised South Africans one million jobs. But now what is happening is the complete opposite. “We are fully behind the unions, who are fighting for the workers at the SABC,” says the provincial convener of the National People’s Front Bhekani Ntshangase. Congress of the People Member of Parliament Dennis Bloem says the board must resign. “We are saying this board and everybody who is harassing these workers, they must resign immediately or we must fire them immediately.” --SABC--
