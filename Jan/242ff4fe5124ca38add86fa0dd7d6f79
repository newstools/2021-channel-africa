Ten cities across China will host the 24-team tournament, which will be held over 31 days, three days more than the 28-day showpiece in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2019. China will host the tournament for the second time after organising it in 2004. “We are confident that the upcoming tournament in China will be the biggest and greatest in Asian football history,” AFC General Secretary, Windsor John said. “We know that the Local Organising Committee (LOC) and the Chinese Football Association will deliver a truly historic tournament in 2023.” The 2019 edition of the quadrennial event was the first to be expanded from 16 to 24 teams. Qatar are the defending champions after winning their maiden title in the UAE. --Reuters--
