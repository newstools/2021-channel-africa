Root and Lawrence, who could make his debut in next week's first Test, added 95 off 129 balls before Team Root declared on 184-2 in Hambantota. Team Buttler struggled in reply as Dom Sibley, Jonny Bairstow and captain Jos Buttler managed a combined six runs. They closed on 120-6 from 38 overs, with Ollie Pope unbeaten on 58. Pope is not in the Test squad or the reserve list as he continues his recovery from shoulder surgery, but is expected to be fit for the tour of India starting next month. Opener Sibley returned to bat for a second time and was unbeaten 18 alongside Pope. They are set to resume on the final day of the two-day match. On a surprisingly green pitch, James Anderson was on a hat-trick earlier in the day, having had Bairstow caught behind and bowling Buttler first ball. Left-arm spinner Jack Leach, who has not played for England for more than a year after illness, took 2-31, removing Dom Bess for three and Ben Foakes for 21.
