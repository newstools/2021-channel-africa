The circumstances of Abdihakim Dhagajuun’s death are unclear. Some reports say he died on Thursday morning in a shoot-out between his bodyguards and government security forces. The government Spokesperson tweeted that the security agencies had been ordered conduct an immediate investigation into the incident “to bring to justice those involved”. Mogadishu Mayor Omar Filish and other top officials have sent their condolences to the family. Two of Dhagajuun’s bodyguards also reportedly died. He had been working as the district commissioner of Hodan, a suburb of the capital, since July 2018. His killing comes hours after another district commissioner in Mogadishu escaped unhurt after a landmine blast killed one of his bodyguards. No group has said it was behind that attack. Islamist al-Shabab militants often carry out targeted killings in Mogadishu and have staged suicide attacks on hotels and government offices. --BBC--
