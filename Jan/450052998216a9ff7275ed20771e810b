Honda suspended output for a few days in December as some British ports struggled to cope with demand caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has disrupted global trade, and goods being stockpiled before a Brexit deal was agreed and ahead of Christmas. Output had resumed on Monday at the southern English Swindon site after the festive break. “The situation is currently being monitored with a view to re-start production on Thursday January 7,” Honda said in a statement.
