The Kenya Airports Authority, the body that manages airports in the country, said the repairs at Jomo Kenyatta International airport are meant to improve passenger experience. It is East Africa's largest airport and is a vital international hub for Africa. Some flight operations have been moved to Terminal 1A and 2 to allow for renovations on Terminal 1B and 1C. "The 12-month airport development project which is estimated to cost 963 million Kenya Shillings ($8.7 million) aims to refurbish the departure halls to improve the check-in, security screening, retail operations as well as passenger lounge experience," the authority said in a statement. --BBC--
