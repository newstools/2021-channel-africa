It is being hailed in some quarters as a wonder drug in fighting the virus. Some doctors claim it is effective in alleviating the suffering of patients who have contracted Covid-19. But Ivermectin is only officially approved for use in treating parasitic diseases in humans and animals, according to Africa CDC Head, Dr John Nkengasong. Speaking to the BBC, Nkengasong said doctors should not use it as a Covid-19 remedy until clinical trials can prove its efficacy. South Africa's University of Free State and Oxford University are conducting separate clinical trials to determine Ivermectin's efficacy to treat Covid-19. Nkengasong, in a tweet, said the second wave of the pandemic is peaking in Africa and that it's crucial for governments and suppliers to unite to get the vaccine out in the numbers needed. South Africa's leading coronavirus expert, Salim Abdool Karim, recently urged the world's wealthier nations not to hoard vaccine supplies, describing the behaviour as "unconscionable" and warning that "no-one is safe until everyone is safe". --BBC--
