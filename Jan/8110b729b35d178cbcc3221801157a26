Singer-turned-lawmaker Wine, 38, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has been arrested multiple times while campaigning ahead of the Jan. 14 vote for breaking laws governing public order and COVID-19 restrictions on large gatherings. Wine is considered to be the leading challenger to President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in office since 1986. On December 30 118 Wine supporters and staff were arrested in the town of Kalangala on Bugala Island in Lake Victoria, where they had travelled to campaign, Wine’s lawyer George Musisi told Reuters. A court in Masaka, about 120 kilometres southwest of the capital Kampala, ordered their release on Monday but Uganda’s prisons service refused to comply, Musisi told Reuters. After obtaining more court release documents on Thursday, 46 people, mostly supporters, were freed while 72, mainly campaign staff, were taken to Makindye military barracks on the outskirts of Kampala, he said. Military spokeswoman Flavia Byekwaso told Reuters she needed time to study the situation before responding.
