The National Institute for Disaster Risk Management and Reduction (INGRD) says the flooding is a result of the overflow of the Limpopo and Shingwedzi rivers due to heavy rains caused by Cylone Eloise. Residents of Chókwè, Guija, Chibuto, Xai-Xai and Limpopo districts are at risk according to the INGRD. INGRD delegate, Manuel Maxhlaieie, has warned those living in those districts to leave the area for their own safety. Cyclone Eloise has brought flooding in parts of Mozambique with officials saying dozens have died, local media reports. The cyclone has also affected several other southern African countries including Zimbabwe. --BBC--
