The samples were collected randomly across the country. The National Director for health survey and observation at the National Institute of Health, Sergio Chicumbe,said the first batch had negative results and hoped it would be the case in the next batches. Chicumbe said that identifying a new variant was time consuming. The country is at risk due to its proximity to neighbouring South Africa that has the new variant. Mozambican Health Minister, Armindo Tiago, had said samples were taken to South Africa and the United Kingdom for testing. --BBC--
