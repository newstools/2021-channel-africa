The 43-year-old former Italy goalkeeper was rushed to hospital after a serious incident on Romeâ€™s busy Via Cristoforo Colombo, Italian media reports said. De Sanctis underwent an operation on an abdominal haemorrhage, where his spleen was removed. He is understood to now be conscious and in a stable condition following surgery. The Italian, who represented the likes of Udinese, Napoli, and Roma during his playing career, returned to the capital club in a backroom role in 2017 following his retirement.
