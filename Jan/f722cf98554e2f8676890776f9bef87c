It said multiple vaccine approvals and the launch of vaccinations in some countries in December had boosted hopes of an eventual end to the pandemic that has now infected nearly 100 million people and claimed the lives of over 2.1 million globally. But it warned that the world economy continued to face “exceptional uncertainty” and new waves of COVID-19 infections and variants posed risks, and global activity would remain well below pre-COVID projections made one year ago. Close to 90 million people are likely to fall below the extreme poverty threshold during 2020 to 2021, with the pandemic wiping out progress made in reducing poverty over the past two decades. 

Large numbers of people remained unemployed and underemployed in many countries, including the United States (US). In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF forecast a 2020 global contraction of 3.5%, an improvement of 0.9 percentage points from the 4.4% slump predicted in October, reflecting stronger-than-expected momentum in the second half of 2020. It predicted global growth of 5.5% in 2021, an increase of 0.3% points from the October forecast, citing expectations of a vaccine-powered uptick later in the year and added policy support in the US, Japan and a few other large economies. It said the US economy - the largest in the world - was expected to grow by 5.1% in 2021, an upward revision of 2% points attributed to carryover from strong momentum in the second half of 2020 and the benefit accruing from $900 billion in additional fiscal support approved in December.
