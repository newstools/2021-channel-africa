Souleymane Condé and Youssouf Dioubaté were also fined 20m Guinean francs ($1 900) each. They were arrested in September 2020 during protests against President Alpha Condé's bid for a third term and accused of producing, disseminating and making available data likely to disturb public order and security. The prosecutor said the pair had called for the arrest of Condé and had accused the authorities of murdering children. The defendants denied making such statements. Condé and Dioubate had already spent four months in prison. Their lawyers said they will appeal against the verdict. --BBC--
