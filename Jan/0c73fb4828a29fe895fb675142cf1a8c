When it first imposed the ban in June, India’s ministry of electronics and information technology (IT) gave the 59 apps a chance to explain their position on issues including whether they censored content, worked on behalf of foreign governments or lobbied influencers. The companies, which include ByteDance’s popular video-sharing app TikTok, Tencent Holdings’ WeChat and Alibaba’s UC Browser, were asked in July to respond to 77 questions amid rising tensions between India and China following a border clash between the two nations. A government panel looking into the app ban decided, after reviewing the responses, that there will be no change in the country’s position for now as the ban was in the interest of India’s national security and sovereignty, one source said. The government has sent notices to the companies informing them of its decision, the source said. It was not immediately clear until when the ban would be in place. The Times of India newspaper reported late on Monday that the ban is permanent. India’s IT ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TikTok said in a statement it is evaluating the notice and will respond to it.
