That is among the contingency plans discussed by the Lions board in the event the trip has to be abandoned. Instead, games would be played in Edinburgh, London, Cardiff, and Dublin. The South African rugby union has previously made it clear that a tour without visiting fans would not be commercially viable for them. The Lions board is also thought to be unenthusiastic about the Idea. However, it is hoped that a vaccine would allow for fans to attend games in the UK by summer. In a statement on Saturday the Lions board announced that they had been having "repeated meetings to discuss all scenarios available and is in constant dialogue". A warm-up contest with Japan is already scheduled for Murrayfield in Edinburgh on 26 June. After that, the original plan is for the Lions to travel to South Africa to play five provincial games before the three-Test series against the world champions. The revised plan would likely see the Test matches held at Cardiff's Principality Stadium and Wembley and Twickenham in London. Government restrictions currently forbid fans from attending, but even if restrictions are lifted, the Lions board is worried that such a large movement of people could put any Covid-19 recovery in jeopardy. It had been mooted that the tour might be delayed until 2022, but all four nations have Test matches scheduled for that summer window and are not keen on that switch.
