Treasury’s statement comes after its meeting with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). According to the Treasury, government will continue to be transparent in its dealings with various vaccine manufacturers. Nedbank economist Isaac Matshego says, “Overall we should pay attention as a country to the issues raised by the International Monetary Fund. In particular, this year’s budget should continue to show a commitment to stabilise government finances. Advances made in addressing the high wage bill are encouraging and I’m confident that we will get a satisfactory budget in February. --sabc--
