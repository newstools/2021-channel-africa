He has met with senior police officials in George before visiting Herold’s Bay and Mossel Bay. Cele says the illegal selling of alcohol is a huge concern. “The other thing that people are refusing to comply with is alcohol. We are getting a lot of information about the underground market. The unfortunate part is when we get you, your license will be taken and you might not trade again. Those on the beach doing that, they need to be arrested as we did yesterday on the West coast.” The sale and distribution of alcohol has been banned until January 15 in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. The Liquor Traders Formation (LTF) has called on the government to permit the sale of alcohol for at-home consumption, subject to limitations, from January 16. The LTF says this will encourage the consumption of liquor at home whilst ensuring the livelihoods of liquor traders. The LTF also calls for the government to consider a moratorium on licence renewals and linked fee increases for a period of not less than one year and that a financial package be offered to all liquor traders to cover their non-trading losses to the value of not less than R20 000 ($1 331). The beer industry urges President Ramaphosa to lift the alcohol sales ban. --SABC--
