Local media are reporting low voter turnout in the local government council elections compared to last week's presidential and parliamentary elections. Political commentator Sarah Biteete told local television station NTV Uganda that the low turnout was expected as some voters were unhappy with how the general elections were conducted. The electoral commission said polling stations will close at 16:00 local time. Popular musician, Jose Chameleon, real name Joseph Mayanja, is contesting to be mayor of the capital, Kampala.
